Apple MacBook AIR Apple M2,This is a great device as a personal laptop or work machine. The Full HD camera is a welcome addition. 6 month M365 subscription is free with this machine and that is a good add-on benefit.

Apple MacBook AIR Apple M2,Most powerful laptop out there.
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M2,I ordered Macbook Air - 8GB RAM and 512GB Storage. I am happy with this product. It's expensive but it is valuable product and worth to have it. I am also happy with Flipkart services. I received it within 3 days. I recommended to buy this kind of expensive product from Flipkart as well.
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M2,"The deep midnight color is striking and adds a touch of elegance. The viewing experience is truly remarkable, providing vivid and immersive visuals. It's suitable for standard video and photo editing tasks. However, for users engaging in intensive video editing, it is advisable to choose the 512GB storage option due to the slower SSD speed of the 256GB model. Overall, considering the features and performance at this price point, it's a compelling deal."

Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"UPDATE 3/8/2023: i bought parallels desktop and a windows 11 license. I need it to try a certain amount of things in IT, however, the performance when running windows in a virtualized environment (like parallels is) it gets seriously affected on the M1, something that didn't happen with intel processors. You notice the performance degrading (but not that much, maybe 10, or even 15% i risk to say) when switching between full screens and main desktop with windows (full separate screen, remember that there's an option to seamlessly integrate within your macOS). You kinda feel the stutter but i can see the M1 processor get in the way and prioritize the screen, and that's a good thing to re-prioritize tasks that are being done in one screen or another (take the word ""screen"" as full-screen apps or software that switches between desktop and full-screen apps or between apps). In my case, running windows 11 makes the mbp m1 run hotter than i'm really use to, but it does not affect battery performance as much as i expected!... weird, isn't it?... love it!If you're going to virtualize something, that isn't Windows, you shouldn't worry that much on this laptop. Just remember that's still have 8gb ram and usable 228gb, therefore, performance wouldn't be the same as bare metal.Still, other regular software from apple or safari (or any other browser), Office365, Adobe XD, Photoshop do not affect performance nor consume that much battery, although if you are a graphic designer or a photographer making a quick change could make you brighten your screen, in which may lead to higher power consumption, which also could be confused by software running.One bad thing that i found with heavy usage is that the keyboard gets ""oily"", meaning, it wears in time and amount of usage per day; funny enough, the aluminum part of the palm rest don't have any signs of wear.Another thing that i found is that the left speaker sounds like it broke when hearing at 70% volume, i don't know if that's fixable or not, anywho anyhow... i'm gonna stick with that because i rarely use it.One thing that i've also found is how i got used to the fact that this mbp m1 takes nothing to return from suspended state, why? Because no matter what other laptop i use (or desktop, for that matter), all of them takes a few seconds to access to their respective desktops and another few seconds to actually be productive (after booting software)... This one literally takes nothing to wake and start using it... that's why i'm not changing this laptop... and yes, even with its flaws... why? because in critical cases when i need to go somewhere and fast react to do something at work, i just do it! it takes me 0 seconds to wake up the mbp and enter another desktop via anydesk or teamviewer or ssh... this takes time on most windows laptops... i love it!I just wish this laptop was upgradeable... after all at the end of the day, it makes my life so useful and convenient despite the down side of it... what a masterpiece! i just wish i could do more and more with it, i feel limited... but happy!and by the way, i still stand on my original review.ORIGINAL: I believe i've found my unicorn because this particular macbook air still lasts an insane amount of time! Although i don't use it on full brightness, i regulate it a lot. Connecting several devices to it via bluetooth is transparent, but unfortunately, Apple made the macOS more inconvenient to handle in terms of simplicity.User experience on the macOS is weird, you know as a mac user where things used to be, then you have to relearn some things and it doesn't feel like home, the new normal isn't good so far.Keyboard is relatively quiet, also, there's the missing keyboard light on this iteration of the macbook air, why did you take (probably) the most useful key from us?! if you're watching a movie you have to literally stop the movie, go through the menu from above and turn off the keyboard lights, or if you're on a presentation and everything is dark, you just turn your screen light down but you can't with your keyboard because you need to actually stop paying attention to the presentation and go through the menu, inconvenient as heck!I know (and i'm very well aware) that there are some workarounds to change to the keyboard light again using a small software... but that isn't the end-game, the thing is that we shouldn't need an extra software or aditional configuration just to use something the macbook had for, literally, over 10 years!Speed on this macbook: you don't even feel it... everything is instant, nothing is slow, if something is, it's most likely the software or the website you're on, is that simple! If you're planning on using massive storage, you should use an usb-c one, not an usb-a through usb-c dongle, you will have a bottleneck, that's guaranteed.I haven't used it on games because that's why i have my pc and xbox for. However, if you're planning on developing software on it, just make sure your libraries fit within 228gb (the half of it is recommended for all ssd's) of storage, if that's gonna be an issue, then go for usb-c massive storage.Weight isn't a problem, it makes you feel like you're having a premium laptop on your hands, but not enough to make your bag heavier. Construction feels like you own something premium and well-made."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"Updated review with more detail [after 2 weeks]. ** See additional note re color.I switched to Mac 11 years ago, and for that entire period, I had the same laptop, a Macbook Pro, late-2011 model. After the initial adjustment, it has been a great laptop for all of these years. I used it for school, work, online browsing, a few applications, and streaming videos. I have never gamed on my 2011 laptop. Of course, it slowed down considerably after several years, and software and hardware updates can only help so much with an older model. So, I finally decided to purchase a new laptop, and based on my research on recent macbook models, the price and value was right on this 2020 Macbook Air.GENERAL FEATURES: Switching from a Pro to an Air model is weird at first because the Air is SO thin and lightweight. It has an extremely slim profile. I have to be extra careful when I grab the laptop to move to another room. Like other reviewers have said, the screen extends almost to the edge with minimal bezel, which also means very minimal border, so you are getting a ""larger"" screen. I did not mind the thick bezel black border on my pro and have been used to it for so long, but I took for granted that it actually provided a lot of protection for my screen. The macbook air has almost no bezel, which in my opinion, is not ideal. Let's hope it doesn't drop or get off balance because there is basically no protection for the screen. My older macbook pro has fallen a few times on it's corner or edge in 11 years and been fine, aside from minor cosmetic damage. But the larger edge and bezel came in really handy on the macbook pro when it lost balance and fell off the counter several years ago, but I quickly saved it by grabbing it by the screen and significantly reducing the impact when it landed [luckily not on hard floor]. Obviously not an ideal way to grab it, but it was a necessary save in that moment. The only damage was cracks through the top of my screen from the pressure of my palm, and some minor dent in the bottom of the laptop. Cosmetic damage, but thankfully did not effect the screen light, LCD, or anything else. I do not think the macbook air would survive this, especially how the screen is built.BATTERY: Upon opening the box, the battery life was already pretty high, and I decided not to charge it until the battery decreased to around 10-15%. I was still using my original macbook during the day for work, and the new macbook air during the evening for mostly online use and going through all of the system preferences and settings, and watching youtube in the background. Keeping that limited use in mind, I did not need to charge it for maybe 1 week. Great battery life thus far. I will likely be shifting to use this macbook air for work soon, in order to take advantage of the current OS, higher ram, and M1 chip, especially because I connect to virtual servers, which can take a toll on the ram and processor.SPEED/PORTS/BLUETOOTH: Compared to an older model pro, it has good speeds so far. I already knew that the number of ports have been reduced significantly, and that air has less ports than a pro anyway, so I purchased a thunderbolt adapter and a USB hub in advance to take care of that issue. So far, the thunderbolt adapter works fine to connect the macbook air to my Thunderbolt Display monitor. The bluetooth was able to connect to my ear buds, although pairing did take a bit longer than I expected. The bluetooth preferences do seem to be less detailed/less options than my previous macbook pro.CHARGER:  ** In my opinion, the previous magnetic chargers were superior to the current ones. They attached via magnet, the indicator light was red while charging, and green when fully charged. Easy and convenient. The mag-safe charger on this computer requires an additional push to be plugged in fully. This is just like most electronic devices, so it is not a bad feature, just requires an adjustment. It is probably safer for the computer and prevents it from easily coming unplugged. However, there is no indicator light, so you can't tell that it is plugged in and successfully charging unless you look at the battery status in the menu bar, and you also cannot see when it is finished charging just at a glance. You cannot confirm when the laptop is closed or on lock screen. You have to open the laptop, log in, and then check. Big bummer. **MISCELLANEOUS FEATURES: My previous macbook had a great feature: check the battery life at a glance with a quick push of a button while the laptop is still closed. After some additional research, I realized that apple removed the battery light indicator on the macbook pros many years ago, and that airs never had this feature. Big bummer. There is no way to check the battery life on this model without opening the laptop AND logging in, as the battery status in the menu bar on lock screen only shows the icon, but won't show you the percentage until you log in. Not ideal at all.-------Quick review for recently purchased product [during Black Friday]. I will update with a more detailed review once I have used it for a longer period.***** Important Note: If you are on the fence about purchasing the ""gold,"" don't get it. I had a silver MacBook Pro for many years, and I went back and forth for several days about the gold, especially after reading recent reviews and viewing customer images on multiple retailers that said the gold is closer to rose gold. I would disagree and say that the color is actually better described as dark blush pink or dark a reddish-mauve. Definitely not the look I wanted to have, and I regret not purchasing the staple silver, especially as I keep my electronics for many years beyond the 'normal time.' It would be a hassle and a lot of money to purchase the silver instead, since we cannot exchange in-store."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"Why is it that the PC world cannot make a good notebook for the same price? The MacBook Air is the bar that every PC model should be at. I bought a PC notebook that has seen more time at the repair depot than in my use. I finally decided to buy a MacBook Air because I was so impressed with a Mac mini I bought. I like everything about the Air from the keyboard, touchpad, beautiful screen quality and study chassis. I was skeptical of the finless design having had Intel MacBook Airs that ran very warm. So far this Apple silicon MacBook has stayed cool to touch. Honestly, I think a M1 MacBook is all many really need for general use cases. I highly recommend a MacBook Air over any PC notebook."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"As a programmer, I can say that this is just the perfect device for work. The battery lasts more than 10 hours, even when watching movies and TV shows.The only exception is when I edit 4k material for video in Davinci Resolve. There, the battery lasts for 3-4 hours. Just like in games. Although I don't play games on this laptop. I ran Froetnite once for a test, I liked it in principle and the FPS was stable 60+.Passive cooling makes this laptop silent. Which is just perfect for audio recording. In addition, it will never get clogged with dust.It's also very convenient that it can be charged via Type-C cable. By the way, I use a third-party charger and there are no problems with this at all."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"I have tried for years to move to a mac given in use an iphone and ipad, however, the office apps in the past were somewhat quirky on a mac.  So finally, they pretty much work the same as on my windows PC with a few exceptions, but for the most part i cant tell a big difference.The mac hardware and OS is way superior to a windows laptop in this price range.  Im primarily a business user and the office suite is what im in daily so now that its very similar to the windows OS version, i dont see myself going back to windows."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"I’m a big Apple fan. I usually use Macbook Pros for work. I decided to get the Air for the days when I don’t need the Pro with me. I like the size and the weight, but there are little glitches here and there that are just very annoying to me. Photos can’t crop more than two pictures at the time without glitches. I do the same on the Pro, no problem. This is easy work and has nothing to do with how ‘powerful’ your computer is. I’m talking about cropping regular phone size pics for social media. No filters or animations or anything like this. It can’t do that.Sometimes when you try to write a post on social media, the space bar moves cursor up as an arrow, rather than a space, usually when you get to the second paragraph of your post. I haven’t noticed this in Pages, just social media. These are small things but when you’re in a hurry, they can be very annoying. The button to change languages is very temperamental, sometimes works, sometimes doesn’t. If you’re trying to write a social media post in two different languages, good luck. You have to select outside of the post pop-up in order to change your language every single time. And IDK, it might be just mine that is doing this, but it’s making me stay away from everything Air.As far as Amazon shipment, delivery and so on, no complains. Everything was as expected for this item."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"First of all, I'm not good with technically stuff... I had difficulty migrating at first especially getting all of my pdf documents over. I got a few Apple support folks to walk me through it. (It took 4 calls to get someone who knew how to change my settings in order to allow me to save documents on the MacBook). Also had to buy a USB-C adapter in order to use my USB hub.It was definitely worth it. Absolutely love it!"
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"This MacBook Air was issued to me a couple of years ago at work. It performs all office and presentation tasks well, with good sound and video controls. It’s extremely light and portable. When I saw it available for the “older model” price I bought one for home use. It now ships with macOS Ventura 13.0."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"I have two MacBook Airs (MBA), a 13"" and a 11, both with the previous form factor (the wide, body colored bezel around the screen, 1280x800 resolution) and this new 13"" MBA improves upon it in every way (almost) and makes it nearly perfect.Good:- SCREEN looks great!  2560x1600 resolution is bright and sharp and looks good with the thin black bezel.  I usually don't go above 50% brightness.- KEYBOARD is good.  Some have mentioned that it still sucks, but I find it much better than the older MBAs that I own and better than say, the Magic Keyboard.  Even with a thin silicone keyboard cover I find the typing experience to be much better and I can type faster and with fewer mistakes.- BATTERY LIFE is fantastic.  Haven't done any real testing yet and obviously it depends on a lot of factors (wifi usage, video streaming, HD vs 4k video viewing/processing/etc., screen brightness, type of app being used, etc.) but for my usage (mostly web browsing, video viewing on YouTube, accessing VPN for work (Citrix, EPIC), etc., it has been great.  Easily tops 10 hours and super impressed so far.- LOOKS GREAT.  Love the newer (I know that the actual exterior design is a few years old by now) design, looks and feels great.  Form factor is nice and it is a reasonable weight.- NO FAN.  That's awesome, as it not only stays quiet all the time but you also do not need to worry about blocking any fan vents on the bottom or back of the case while you have it on your lap.  Pretty amazing really for a laptop to have no fans.- PERFORMANCE.  It works great so far on what I have used it for, which is not terribly a lot, but it is what it is for a laptop using Apple silicon for the first time.  For just day to day use and things like Chrome, Office (Word, Excel), Citirx, EPIC, etc., it has been super smooth and fast.  Have not tried gaming yet but do not have high hopes given it is the base model with 7-core GPU.  Also, things like start up are noticeably faster with the M1 versus my 2020 iMac 27"" (top end) with Intel chips.- TOUCH ID is great still.  Works very fast and the button does not get greasy (which makes it not work well) like the old iPhone home buttons.  On the other hand, it should really have Face ID at this point.- APPLE ECOSYSTEM is great as usual and a real reason to get this MBA.  Apple Watch easily unlocks it (so you do not really need Face ID if you have the watch).  You can easily send/receive files using AirDrop or cast using AirPlay.  And so on and so forth.- BIG SUR comes preinstalled but you need to update to get 11.0.1.NOT GOOD:- WEBCAM still sucks.  Still low resolution and just does not look good in FaceTime, Teams, etc.  Shame that Apple is so slow to upgrade webcams on the Macs (the 27"" iMac FINALLY upgraded to 1080p front cams only a couple months ago... I got one and it looks so much better than this MBA's camera).- ONLY 2 PORTS.  Sad that this thing has only 2 USB-C ports (that cover thunderbolt 3, USB 3.1, charging, DisplayPort).  Given that it is used to charge, it leaves only one USB-C port for other use, pretty lame.  I wish they had squeezed (I think it would fit) a USB-A port so that I could plug in my wireless mouse USB-A dongle as I have never liked any bluetooth mouse, or at least one more USB-C port.- NEW TECH (Apple silicon) means the M1-optimized apps are still being rolled out, e.g. Photoshop still not available at release.- BATTERY still cannot be removed, no surprise here, but means that like all Apple mobile tech it will have a useable lifespan determined at least partly by the non-removable battery.  Easier to have an iPhone's battery replaced than a MBA I would imagine but hopefully it maintains a high level of performance for 4 years at the minimum.OVERALL:A few negatives (mostly the webcam) but enough significant improvements that this MBA is really a no-brainer for anyone needing a non-power notebook compute, especially if s/he is already in the Apple ecosystem.  Love it so far!"
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,Use it with the Apple keypad folio and you basically have a lap top for less money.
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,Perfect for my daughter who is a student.
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"After 40 years of using (and building) PCs, I switched to an 27 inch iMac. I needed better accessibility features than Windows could provide. The chance was easier than I anticipated and I've found no reason to use Windows emulators. In the past, I've enjoyed the convenience of having a laptop. But I just couldn't see them well enough anymore. So I took a leap of faith spurred on by a great Amazon Deal at $799.Setup was very easy.. it just cloned everything on my iMac that I wanted to transfer over.  The screen is bright and easy to see even for me. The keyboard feels good and the trackpad works well. There's a fingerprint ID to unlock it... very convenient.This is the M1 MacBook Air. I purchased it shortly after the M2 MacBook Air came out. It was 18 months old but that's what provided the exceptional price. The M2 based MacBook would be faster and offered MagSafe charging, and a brighter display. There were also several handy ports lacking on the M1 model. But the M2 has an overheating problem that the M1 doesn't. I didn't think these features were work several hundred more dollars.This M1 MacBook is fast enough and has reasonably good battery life. But there are a few drawbacks that I was aware of before I made the purchase:The only ports are a headphone jack and two Thunderbolt connectors. To solve this issue, I bought a small dock.You're buying the base model with a 128g solid state drive. This is less than ideal but there are workarounds. First, you can purchase an inexpensive drive (solid state if possible) and offload some things to that drive. Another option is to upgrade your iCloud storage to 50gb for .99 cents a month.Is this a good deal? The answer is YES!"
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"We are big fans of Apple products, especially their laptops. I was looking for a low cost upgrade from an old 15” 2013 MacBook Pro that lasted a very long time. This M1 MacBook Air was a perfect replacement, especially on a Black Friday sale. It’s incredibly fast for all we use it for, and has a good battery life. Much more portable than the old laptop we came from. Overall, it got me up to modern day technology without spending for the latest and greatest. very happy!"
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,Honestly… I have twins and bought them both this as a graduation gift from high school to have in college and could not afford to just outright buy two but Amazon came to our rescue and we made extremely affordable payments! Thank you Amazon!!! The twins love them!!!
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,Ordered this for my granddaughter to use for her college classes.  She was very pleased with it when it arrived.  Would definitely order again.  Very nice product.
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,This laptop was renewed and arrived in excellent condition. It looks brand new and is working great!
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,Very satisfied. Looks great. Works great.
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"Intuitive, easy to use"
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"I bought this 2020 MacBook Air (8 GB RAM, 256 GB SSD storage) to replace a 2014 MacBook Air (4GB RAM, 256 GB SSD storage).  I am undeniably a fan of Apple products in general, because they work with little fuss and are built to last (note that my old MacBook Air is more than 7 years old and still working perfectly).  Although I've been underwhelmed by some Mac models in recent years, this one is stellar IMHO.  Unless you have very heavy system requirements this machine would be an excellent choice.The M1 processor is very impressive, delivering outstanding performance and power/thermal efficiency simultaneously.  Battery life is every bit as good as advertised; I can charge overnight and use it all day without plugging in.  Connecting USB devices such as external drives will shorten battery life, but that's to be expected.  I love the fanless design, which means the machine is absolutely silent at all times, while the thermal efficiency of the M1 chip allows it to remain amazingly cool.  In use, this computer feels very fast, especially with apps optimized for Apple processors (as MacOS Big Sur is).  Interestingly, Microsoft has been on board early with M1 optimization; the latest Office 365 version is smooth and fast on this machine.  I also tried out MS Edge on my new laptop based on a recommendation from another user and have been so pleased with its speed and efficiency that it's my current default browser.  The touch ID and Apple Pay capability is a welcome addition.The only cons I see are minor in my opinion.  Because RAM is integrated into the M1 processor, post-purchase memory expansion is not possible; if you think you'll need 16 GB of memory that model can be had from the Apple Store.  There has been criticism of the fact that this machine has only two ports, which is fair.  For me that's not insurmountable; I simply use a USB-C hub to provide additional connectivity.  I've read recently that some users have had certain hubs cause problems with their M1 Macs, which appears to be related to battery charging through these hubs.  To be on the safe side I use a built-in port for charging and have had no issues.Reading through the relative handful of critical reviews, it looks to me like most (excluding actual defects, which happen with all products) are based on lack of understanding.  For example, I saw a large number of reviews complaining that this machine ""has NO USB PORTS!!!"", which is patently false.  In fact, its two ports are both USB, they just require a different connector.  What these users are looking for is the old USB-A connectors, which this MacBook does not have; however, that's easily fixed by using a USB-A to USB-C converter cable, or with a USB-C hub.  USB-A peripherals are gradually disappearing as well, in favor of the new connector.All things considered, I really love this machine.  The $899 price (at the time I bought mine) was $100 less than I would have paid at the Apple Store, and I believe I can probably get $200 on eBay for my old MacBook Air (try that with a 7-year-old PC!) leaving me with a total outlay of $699.  Considering that I'll almost certainly get 5 or more years use out of this model, I'm very happy with my purchase and would do it again."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,Very nice
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,Needs better charging ports
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"The only regret is not doing enough research first. My needs call for a Pro. I push this computer to the max, but it’s still faster than Windows."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"I'm no tech expert. The last laptop I owned was a 2015 MacBook Pro (13-inch), which I used daily until the battery became too weak to hold a charge for more than a couple of hours. That's normal after you've gone through the standard 1000 recharge cycles and seven years of use. It served me well.I pretty much only use this thing to write Amazon reviews and so far it's doing the job well. I will say the Air is the lowest model of the MacBooks and I bought the 2020 M1 model rather than the newest one available for 2022. Going from a 2015 Pro, I noticed this machine is noticeably stronger in performance. It's also lighter and quieter because it has no cooling fans (doesn't really heat up so it doesn't need them).My only real complaint I'll say at this point is the lack of ports. You get two USB-C ports and a regular headphone jack. I'm glad they at least decided to keep the headphone jack. So you'll most likely need to buy a dongle or some adapter to expand your ports which then makes the laptop clunky and less portable.I'll finish with this - if you don't know the pros and cons of buying an Apple vs non-Apple (usually Windows-based) laptop, definitely look that up. There are basics you should know like Apple is not gaming-friendly and installing software in their OS vs Windows is quite different."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"It’s been a few years since I’ve purchased a MacBook as I have anas I have been using windows laptops the past seven or eight years. My intent for using this one was for a consulting business I am a part of doing teaching presentations, etc. I wanted something that was small and traveled easy but also durable. Using this was a pleasure from the keyboard to the color and clarity of the screen. It feels good in the hand and seems like a very premium and quality product  I use this laptop for a job one day recently and literally at full brightness for around 8 1/2 hours on its battery. What I found is I liked it so much that I added more applications to make this my daily laptop but the standard 8 GB it came with just wasn’t enough. I was getting RAM full warnings at least once or twice a day. I have since given this laptop to my wife who had a 2011 Air and have purchased a new 16 GB M2 version for myself. As nice and robust, and as good looking as this laptop, is I highly recommend it but if you think for a moment that you might need extra ram, go ahead and bump up to the next level. in my opinion, this is the best $1000 laptop on the market with the best battery life and quality overall."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,Love it
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"I was very surprised to open the package and find that the box for the Apple MacBook was literally taped shut and there was a sticker saying “thanks to you this product has a second life“. The laptop itself seems unused and works perfectly as expected. I would like Amazon to explain the packaging in the sticker, because this has definitely been opened before."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,I love it!! I’m so glad I got this one. Love the lightness.
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"The media could not be loaded.
                



 I’ve really been wanting a laptop and I use apple products. I’ve heard great things about MacBooks in the past.  I enjoy it for writing college papers, internet searches, iMessage while I’m using it and not my phone is helpful for receiving messages, emailing for school and work. It doesn’t have a lot of games that download from my iPhone 13, but that would be my only complaint. Pretty sure Apple moved away from downloading each app separately like Facebook, Instagram, YouTube and has one app called ‘finder’ . I would recommend to a friend this MacBook Air."

Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"Got this as a Christmas gift from the hubby and I'm still in love with it. He bought it to replace my old macbook air I've had since 2013, and boy is it a nice upgrade. The colour matches my apple watch and my ipad, and it's so FAST. The m1 is amazing. I have a 16 GB Sims 4 Mods folder, and it still runs fast as heck on high graphics. No more airplane noises and overheating either!!! Love it"

Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"I recently migrated to Apple after many years using a wide variety of PCs running Windows or Linux. I decided to make that move after Apple's introduction of the M1 processor, which has been proven to be an excellent hardware platform. Now. of course, the M2 has been released, but, depending on your needs, the 2020 Macbook Air with the M1 will save you some money while still delivering outstanding performance and some of the most attractively and perfectly manufactured hardware. You can search the Internet for professional reviews of the Macbook Air, but I feel confident you'll find plenty to verify what I'm saying.The Retina display is beautiful. The sound system is superior to any other laptop I have owned or used. The battery holds up all day under typical use, and I can verify that the battery holds its charge well for at least a week while the notebook is powered off. The Apple OS (Monterey) is smooth and fast, and I was able to learn my way around in it quickly. When you need help, a Google search will yield tons of tips quickly, or you can avail yourself of Apple support.I will say that the Air is a little short on USB ports, lacks a built-in card slot, and, of course, is not equipped with a touchscreen. However, I have run a USB hub from one of the two Thunderbolt ports, and there seems to be enough power to support my flash drives and card readers...even a portable DVD-burner. As far as a touchscreen goes, I have that on a Dell laptop I run Linux on, but I never use it...guess I'm a mouse or touchpad guy.The aluminum housing is beautifully machined and finished, the keyboard has a very nice touch, the battery seems to charge quickly, and the Air is light at under 3 lbs.One last thing! I have been a heavy user of both Google and Microsoft services, and I have found that Apple provides ample support for integrating those services into the Mac environment. I run Google's Backup and Sync and Microsoft's OneDrive with no problems. My AVG subscription allows me to use my antivirus software on both Mac OS and Windows machines.I have no regrets for this purchase. Actually, the Air was my 3rd M1 Mac. I also have an iMac and a Mac Mini. They all work together very well!"
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,I originally bought it for gaming. Unfortunately not many good games available on M1 yet. So it is now used for business and video editing!
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,its good quality only problem is some games cant be played on here because they are not compatible with mac ios. if you are wanted this to get games off steam this isnt the right computer for that but i love this computer i use it everyday.
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"I went with a mac after always using pc/windows. I was tired of microsoft always bundling crap junk in with every thing that sucked up ram & cpu. It was a good decision, this mac is great, no issues so far. Only thing that bums me out is that the fifa video game doesn't work on mac, and also, the safari browser isn't supported by everything out there. Oh, and some apps it won't install/run for system safety concerns, which is prolly for my own good, lol"
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"Update:I saw some reviews that said their 3rd party usb hub broke their Mac. I've been using a usb-c to usb-a for a few weeks now with no problems (made by UNI). It's worked for everything I threw at it; Logitech G910 keyboard, Razor mouse, Yamaha digital piano, RME Audio Interface, Roland A-49 midi keyboard. They all worked. I also have a cheapo Amazon Basics single usb adaptor cord about 6"" long, and it too works with everything on the MacBook.After decades of looking through Bill Gates' Windows, I bought my first Mac but only because of the new M1 chip, where everything is on this one chip, which makes it faster. Applications optimized for the M1 now rival high end PCs (and for the first time too). I never was interested in Macs because they were overpriced and underpowered, but it looks like that worm has turned. Just don't buy an earlier version of Macs, especially with Intel chips.Keep in mind when/if you buy this, there are NO upgrades later on; ZERO, NADA, nothing to change out. You can't add RAM nor Storage once it's built. (There is a workaround on storage, by adding an external SSD drive, but as I understand it there are some problems viewing what is on your external drive, but that may change over time.)Also, SSD storage, while blazingly fast and so worth it, need about 10% 'headroom.' That is for example, if you have 256GB storage, you can only use 230GB as you need a 10% reserve to account for SSDs getting used up. It's the nature of the beast. And of course the preinstalled software also takes up storage space from day one. For my PC I bought a 250GB SSD and found that it was maxing out pretty fast, so I replaced with a 1TB SSD and have already filled up half of it, but I don't expect to fill it up completely anytime soon. It should be good for maybe a decade or so.So bottom line, get at least the 512GB storage or you'll be sorry. It does kind of suck that Apple charges so much for each step increase in storage, but paying the extra $200 in this case is worth it, IMHO. The jury is still out on if you need 16BG of RAM vs the 8GB models currently in stock, (Apple treats it like a custom order at this time, with a waiting period.)  If it was a PC, then getting 16GB RAM is a no-brainer, but in the case of the M1 chip, it shares memory within the chip, making the most use of it. I have 32GB in my PC because RAM sticks are relatively cheap.Remember, once you buy a MacBook, it will stay as is. Upgrades are impossible (which has always been the case for notebooks anyway)."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"I love it, amazon delivery is ????"
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,I’ve always wanted a MacBook since the super old ones first came out but I never had the money. Now I’m obviously not a kid anymore so I make my own money and was able to afford this for my classes that start soon. I found a great deal on cyber Monday and I’ve been using this computer for over a month now. Have zero problems and I’m just in love with how sleek it looks and feels. I’m huge on apple products so that’s also a plus is how easy it is to use. I’ve been watching some Netflix on it as well sometimes and the sounds quality and screen quality are amazing. 10/10. I was hesitant from other reviews saying it was musty smelling or used but mine was brand new and wasn’t smelly.
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,I am satisfied with the product.
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,Absolutely the best price I could find!!!!
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,Great price for a great machine. Amazon did a great job on delivery.
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"I had an old MacBook Air that was having problems.  I didn't want to break the bank replacing it so I got this 2020 model. I was a wary of buying a computer online, but it arrived well packed and in pristine condition.  The set up was easy.  But a warning:  when Apple says it's easy to migrate data from your old Mac to a new Mac over your residential wifi, don't believe them!  To do it in a reasonable amount of time, you'll need to buy a Thunderbolt 4 and a type c connector dongle, so be prepared in advance.  There's no ethernet port in this model and using residential wifi to migrate data is an exercise in frustration (would take 30+ hours).  Other than that, I've had no significant issues so far.  Battery life is very good."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"i am a windows man way back 40 yrs.  since i used windows software for work i saw no reason to switch to apple.  although i did have an apple  IIc for fun way back in the early pc daysMy surface pro entry model has been around for many yrs and the battery has run down and mostly i use it plugged in. I decided to try a mac to learn something new. After research i decided to get the mac air m1 w 8GB ram and the 512GB SSD - this is what i learned ( not going into why i decided what i did as anyone can do the same research1. setup and initial use was not as easy as advertised- couldnt get past the country selection and found after search many had same problem. almost returned it but i finally found i could move selection by tab key AND selection based on space press and  NOT return key - track pad was useless - ( it had a little to do with track pad setup that can only be performed later as well as track pad difference from MS product) .windows and track pad usage not same as windows and i couldn't resize screen windows or even drag them on the screen -plenty of tutorials on you tube - but none really helped decipher selection until i figured it out watching an excel tutorial on how to select and drag cells - you have to ""hard"" press.This hard press finally solved the moving and resizing windows issues - again none of this info was included with product.2. very confusing from reviews n QnAs whether or not this mac had 7 or 8 core GPU - according to internal report its 8 core3. what have i learned -- very lightweight machine- lots of internal tweaking can be done to personalize machine- very fast on the task used - browsing and some excel files now needing to run under mac for which i purchased new software- beautiful screen- great battery life- particularly liked my iphone messages show up on the mac and i can send and receive on same - apple makes computer look sim to phone4. recommendation - for 1000$ to 1200$ a student or any one like me, whos not going to program or have a gazillion windows open or need a large screen, can get this machine - a comparable windows machine would cost same but a windows machine can also be purchased for a lot less and still be capable of student tasks.However, the battery life and weight and integration w iphone tip the scales to this machine if you want to purchase a comparable MS product"
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"I am very impressed, as a lifetime windows user I never thought I would buy a Mac. Its the battery life, quietness, and lack of heat that impress me the most. I have never even gotten the battery to half yet, and I have left it on for days.Since I already have an Iphone and Iwatch the interaction between the 3 is a bonus (getting text messages from the phone to the laptop, my watch telling me if I left the laptop behind, etc.)I mainly use the mac for learning python and the mac os, along with light gaming for airplanes, etc. Its perfect.I don't see myself ever buying a windows laptop until they are whisper quiet, cool to the touch, and the battery lasts for many days instead of a few hours like this does."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,First new Mac I’ve bought. I’m not going back to anything else.
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"I love this laptop! It’s easy to use, light, and has a good screen! I highly recommend!"
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"simplemente satisfecha, me encanta y es mi gran aliada..la recomiendo"
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"Even in 2022, this laptop is a solid choice. As can be expected from Apple, the build quality feels premium. It is lightweight yet sturdy and the hinge feels great as well. I can open the screen to any angle I want without worrying about it feeling flimsy. Coming from an older, heavier laptop with loud fans, I appreciate the fanless design of this MacBook immensely as I never have to feel like I am disturbing anyone with loud fans.The battery life is another area where this laptop excels. The battery can easily last a full day of normal use, so I do not have to constantly look around for outlets to keep it charged.Gaming wise, it could perform better. It can handle some light games, but don't expect to be playing any of the newer demanding games on it. It doesn't have a dedicated video card or anything, but I knew that going in."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"I'm a software developer and I've only used PC for my entire career. I've been using the windows subsystem for Linux and other Unix based shells for work for a long time and I've always had the desire to try development on a Mac.I assumed that it would be like any other Windows machine that's had the OS replaced with Linux, one of my favorite computers was a Lenovo with Ubuntu on it so that's what I expected.I bought a Surface Pro X which has an ARM based processor (ms sq1 chip) so I thought that I knew what to expect, I assumed that it would be frustrating that the majority of the software I used probably wouldn't work correctly but I have to say that Apple did so much better than Microsoft on this one. The M1 chip makes this $1,000 laptop feel like a $2500 laptop. I've only run into one application that couldn't run and the general online community recommended an alternative for me.the most difficult thing for me was getting used to the different keyboard layout but once I did, this laptop has been nothing short of a pleasure to work with and has replaced my Surface laptop 3 as my daily driver and primary software development machine.I might revert to my Surface laptop three if I go back to .NET development in the future but for the general web stuff I typically do, I couldn't ask for a better machine.The battery life is excellent, this laptop feels premium, I have no doubt that this will last me well into the future and it has completely changed my mind about Apple.The biggest downside in my opinion is that I spent a fortune on accessories and peripherals because Apple products tends to exist in their own separate ecosystem which can be a bit frustrating.One thing that everyone should be aware of is that you can't connect this laptop to two separate external displays. I had to get used to One external display and then using a virtual desktop. That is unfortunate because I really liked having three monitors at all times but I haven't found a way to make it work with this machine.Generally speaking, I would recommend this to anybody who's considering it. Unless you are a PC gamer, there's very little that this computer won't excel at. I'd argue that it might be the best quality laptop in this price range by a factor of two, and I have historically been very critical of Apple."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"Love my Macbook Air! After a year I did have to get it fixed because of an inner issue that I didn't cause, but still under warranty so that was nice. I wish Apple would make matte screens... but that's on Apple. I MISS my old Macbook Pro with matte screen that I could use without glare for graphic design and even in the sun!! BRING BACK MATTE SCREENS, Apple!!"
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"I have had the M1 MacBook Air 13-inch now since December 2020. It has served me so well and has been one of the most reliable laptops I've ever owned. I am originally a PC guy and now work back and forth between Windows OS and Mac OS.When it comes to rendering videos and clips, this does a way better job at 4K resolution compared to my former Alienware 17 inch laptop AND my workplace's gaming desktop!I am pretty happy with the battery life so far. I have been getting 10+ hours of hard real-world usage. I bring a nice USB-C portable battery with me to charge it when I am doing work on the weekends out of town or while on the plane. This thing has not failed me once.8GB of RAM is more than enough for the majority of consumers and is enough for me even though I edit photos and videos all the time. I have not seen any ""throttling"" from the M1 MacBook Air since ownership. I can even open up 30+ tabs on Chrome without issue.256GB storage is enough as long as you have an external storage. I highly recommend investing in getting an SSD or NVMe external storage so transfer speeds are optimal. Otherwise, as long as you are keeping the core hard drive tidy, you won't run into any storage issues.Virtual classes are nice. The webcam quality is crystal clear, and it is noticeably better than most of my peers.My only complaint is that the design is a bit ""outdated"" despite how premium and beautiful it is.Just FYI. I just bought two of these; one for myself and one for my friend who just had a massive upgrade from her ""prehistoric"" 2010 iMac. She was absolutely mindblown by how much faster and better it is compared to the older iMac.Overall, this is a very nice all-around computer laptop for ANY student from K all the way up to the graduate level. Go get this beast of a machine now for $850."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,I received a brand new product. I like it . It’s Very beautiful.
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"I love it.  Thin as a pad of paper, silent, works great as an apple should.  Good size to take with you or watch videos.  The silent part is key when steaming video."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"I love this laptop. It replaced an Acer aspire 5 slim, which was quite heavy, and had a battery that lasted five hours. In power saver mode. It was only two years old and rarely used until I started a new job and school. I had my MacBook going from 8:30 AM to 8:30 PM pretty much consistently, and it still had 55% battery life. Because I have an iPhone, I can make calls and send texts with it. My iPad can be used for sidecar, which is basically wireless screen mirroring, allowing me to have a portable second monitor. The mac doesn’t skip a beat- I can leave it closed overnight, and everything is exactly the same the next morning without crashing or reloading. It’s not at all heavy, and the size is exactly what a laptop should be. The Mac OS not supporting steam titles thing isn’t a huge deal- If I want a gaming machine, I have a desktop. For getting things done, this is an absolutely perfect daily driver, and I wouldn’t hesitate to recommend it to anyone. My one gripe is lack of USB-A ports, but I’ll buy an adapter and move on with my life. Overall, try a MacBook Air… You’ll like it. UPDATE: I found a program called Parsec and so long as my Mac has a stable WiFi connection, I can remote into my desktop and use steam along with everything else."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"I received this refurbished unit with the hope that I could Facetime my family back east. Sadly, no matter what I did I could not get past the migration screen. Finally deciding to go through the migrating data from my pc to my new mac, it didn't work. Now, as you can guess, I'm not a mac user but the whole process was more than I could deal with so I decided to return the macbook to Amazon. It's been weeks since UPS dropped it off and I'm still waiting for a credit and, yes, I had contacted Amazon before returning the mac. So, all I can say is, unless you know how to use a mac, don't waste your time. It's not user friendly or easy to use and if you return it, you'll have to wait weeks to get a refund."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"Easy to use, compact. Loved it!"
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"This is the best laptop I've ever owned and I've owned about twenty or more.  For most folks, this 2020 model will be more than enough: great battery life, excellent display, excellent Mac OS and UI, robust build quality, easy portability, ... and I love the aluminum case.  I own four Windows 11 laptops too, which are great laptops as well, but this Mac tops them."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"If you are using the M chip for the first time, be advised that many programs that run on intel chips will not work. As of this writing there are no ""work arounds,"" except for iTunes. You will need to have a mouse to efficiently use the interface. And C USB hub will allow access to work of previous versions of the OS. It is very fast machine. The migration assistant did not work properly for me and corrupted the operating system requiring professional repair. It will take some time get used to its new features that I can use. I am not a gamer. I mainly use word processing for educational purposes."

 I love it"
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,Got this as a gift during prime day sale. It came very promptly. I also live in an apartment complex and have a special kiosk system for packages. It's nice when I am out of town which I was when the package came. It came earlier than expected. I don't usually use the kiosk but they left it in there for me all securely. Laptop works great. The gift was a success as well! The only thing is that the camera could be better. My boyfriend needed a laptop due to his Lenovo shutting down and a nice camera (his old one stopped working) to confirm his identity for online tests. He tested it out and it was pretty blurry for a pricey laptop which is why I give this 4 stars instead of 5.
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"This thing is amazing. I have owned several windows gaming laptops and this is hands down the best laptop I have ever purchased. The build quality is amazing, the chassis, hinge, keyboard, and mousepad all feel very high quality. the laptop is light and easy to carry around. The battery lasts what feels like a lifetime. The computer does not get hot at all (even after some heavy video editing and transcoding). Apple has truly made the best laptop on the market. Now to the negatives: I have read that the OS excessively uses virtual memory to speed up the system. After doing some initial tests I can confirm that this is true. What does this mean? this means that the Internal SSD might not last as long as it should because of the excessive write and read to the Solid state drive. I don't know I this is by design or what but it definitely feels kinda crummy for Apple to do this. I would still recommend this computer to anyone needing a laptop for school, creative work, or just general use. Buy it you won't regret it."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,It is my first macbook and I really love it.
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,Replaced an older Mac AIR.The transfer of all data went very smoothly EXCEPT...please note.WRITE DOWN each time a special temporary PW is assigned during transfer.This will occur twice I believeIt's too long to recall later.I did not.Also.... assume that an older printer will not work.
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"I got this for my wife as she is in grad school. She writes a lot and uses it for research. She has raved about how fast it loads web pages and how easy it is to login to her Mac Book with the fingerprint scanner. She also uses it to play Sims, which it runs flawlessly. Highly recommend this for people who do a lot of browsing the web, writing, and casual gaming."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"La compré para actualizar mi iMac de casi 10 años que ya anda algo lenta. La nueva iMac no me agrada su diseño, así que también por presupuesto adquirí esta MacBook Air M1 a muy buen precio, es muy ligera lo cual hace que pueda transportarla fácilmente. Es realmente rápida comparada con mi antigua Mac y con la compu del trabajo.El principal uso que le doy es ofimática, algo de diseño de fotos y videos, navegar en internet, Spotify, YouTube, correos, Netflix y así.Cuando la configuré al inicio, se calentó bastante sin aparentemente estar haciendo nada y me preocupé pero leí que es normal al configurar la laptop por primera vez, después que ya quedó lista, ocupó de varias horas eso sí, no ha vuelto a molestar con altas temperaturas.Ahora bien, no es que le he dado un uso intensivo así que no podría decir si en realidad se calienta mucho al llevarla a un uso extremo. Como aun no es mi computadora principal, no la uso mucho a diario, por lo que me ha durado la batería, después de cargarla al 100 %, casi una semana llegando al 15 % al quinto día sin apagarla de un día para el otro, solo la cierro y la uso al día siguiente; hago esto porque he leído que así funciona mejor Mac OS.En unos meses pienso realizar una actualización de esta opinión de usuario.Ahhhhh!!!, de ley consigan un USB-C hub, yo compré uno con 3 USB-A y una entrada para ethernet."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"This M1 replaces a 2015 MacBook Air. It's actually the second M1 Air in our family (I bought a refurbished one earlier this year to replace a retiring 2012 Air), and at $799 for the 8 GB RAM / 256 GB SSD model is an insanely great value.Some of the other recent reviews mentioned a musty odor and speculated these had been in storage or previously used. There was a slight musty or chemical odor when the box was opened, but upon checking carefully I found the smell originated from the included printed materials, NOT the computer itself or the packaging. There was absolutely no sign of mold, moisture, or dampness in the box, the sealed packaging, or the laptop.Installing and running a utility showed this Air was assembled in August 2022 and had so far logged no battery cycles. It's a new M1 Air, not old stock. (The 2020 date in the description is the year the M1 Air model was introduced, not when this computer was made.)"
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,The computer works fine and Im happy with my purchase. The box does smell like mold? I saw other reviewers post prior to purchasing - just thought I’d mention it’s def a thing. No issues with the computer itself so far. I haven’t had it long though.
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"This is the most impressive tech I've purchased in a while even after 2 years since its original launch, this laptop still blows everything else in the market even when compared to its newer brother the M2 Air. My only con is the chunky bezel on top because I came from laptops with slimmer bezels all around but I think it's still worth getting this laptop in 2023. The performance and battery of this device is just unmatched."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"This was my first Mac and I will say that I love it. Switching from a PC to a Mac was not as difficult as everyone makes it out to be. This computer is perfectly slim and lightweight, has a perfect keyboard and track pad, and is super fast."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"I've always been a PC user. This Apple MacBook Air is beautiful, although a 2020, packaged as new in it's original box.  Transferring files from my old computer was painless.  Love everything about it AND it was shipped 2 days earlier than they said.  I'm thrilled with this company and this product. Thank you"
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"Not long ago I decided to get far from Apple products because some work necessities I couldn't cover with an iPhone and a Mac. The limitation of the Iphone for some advanced features (like dual SIM and the possibility to flash OS images from a ssd) and the need to use bootcamp in the Mac made me jump to an android phone and a windows computer.I had a Samsung s10+ and a Huawei Matebook pro with windows and linux. Both devices are impeccable. Really made my work easier in so many aspects. But as time passed my life wasn't getting simpler like it was with my Iphone and my Mac.Apple products work flawlessly between each other and there are always new implementations that simplifies everyday life. Quality of this products and its software is incredible. Although other products have better capabilities ( for example my Matebook outperforms this MacBook Air m1 and has a much better quality screen) they lack the simplicity and stability.Being all this said, The MacBook Air M1 is a really great laptop. The most basic version which is the one I bought is blazing fast, stable and with a great battery life (much better than the Huawei Matebook pro). Also its absolute silent and fresh. Its doesn't get hot at all.To make my work easier I had to pay for some software that saddly I was denied to pay on the Mac at the beginning.  Apple products are expensive but I've learned that in the long run they are worth it. Life is about time and how you spend it and apple definitely focus its effort to simplify the time you use to do a task.I wanted to share my story in case you are in a situation like I had. If you have an iPhone and other Apple products don't doubt. Buy a Macbook Air M1. I still have a beefy windows machine for gaming, rendering, and other things. But most of the time I rather work in my new MacBook."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"I love the operating system on this here Mac but for the price paid, the screen shouldn't had any bubbles at all. I notice the bubbles in the screen once I turned it off.  I didn't notice it at first because when I took it out the package and opened it up, the computer automatically comes on. Therefore, given the high resolution of the screen I wasn't aware until turning it off.Hopefully I'll get a response from the seller..."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"Purchased this primarily for video editing, never used a MacBook before however I had experience with their pro iPads and phones.  Coming from windows it did take some getting used to, but overall enjoying the video editing aspect."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,This macbook is the best! I love it. It's fast and the memory is enough for me. I haven't had any issues! I have a mac desktop and I needed a great laptop for work. This was my first choice!
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"It's not a bad little laptop.  I am NOT a techie person so don't expect fancy tech terms or a deep understanding of all things Apple in this review.  I'm your standard user looking for a dedicated, decent machine for work without breaking the bank.The M1 chip is supposed to be crazy fast compared to the previous version and yes, so far it is pretty good.  I use a graphic webpage called Canva and I am constantly getting a message telling me that it's using excessive power & slowing my Macs performance down.  This even happens with Candy Crush..  I haven't noticed any decrease in performance though.I also have the 2018 MacBook Air and it's FaceTime video is FAR superior to this 2020 version which is very low quality and grainy.. I think my 2014 HP has a better quality video.  So if you're looking for clear, crisp video for Zoom meetings you won't find it here.  I mean really, I expected a LOT more from an Apple product.The power cord is not magnetic like the 2018, which to me was a much better design.  ""Someone"" is forever tripping over my cord and yanking it out which was fine with the 2018 version but this one will end up damaged if I can't find a way to get it out of the way.  Small spaces are challenging :)I had to buy a compatible hub so that I could continue using my USB wireless mouse & flash drives since this MacBook Air only has 2 ""thunderbolt usb"" ports & one of them is for the power cord.  It's not backwards compatible with all of my standard USB devices and no place at all for an SD card.I do LOVE the convenience fingerprint login/keychain feature.  I love that it's very quiet (so far) and other than FaceTime the colors and screen resolution are excellent and vibrant as advertised."

 i loved it grate"
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,I purchased this computer for my 15 year old daughter for Christmas.  It is exactly what she wanted and she was thrilled to receive it.  She immediately made it her own and says it is the best computer!  Thank you!
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,I’ve been wanting a MacBook for the longest and when I came across this I was very suspicious about it but read the reviews and gave it a shot!! And so happy I did even tho my first one was stolen from Amazon but I called right away once I was alert my package may have been lost and they was able to send me out another one with no problem so I thank Amazon for that!!!
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,read above
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"Insane battery life.  Like It runs for days.Complies c++ code fast as hell.Plays my favorite 2d games life Stardew valley on steam, and starsector.Construction is great.This really is an incredible product, very happy with it"
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,Perfect replacement!
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"I specialize in tech and we now have three of these in the family. Two years after first release, it’s still a screamer! Presently it hits the sweet spot between price and superb M1 chip performance. The M1 was a revolution, while the M2—at $300 more—is merely an evolution. If you can find it on sale in the $800 range, this is indeed the laptop to choose, folks."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"I love me some apple products! Absoutely beautiful gold. It’s brand new, sealed. Came very quick and in perfect condition. Set up is quick, the Touch ID is super fast. My iPad Pro has the M1 and let’s just say, it’s a game changer. Highly recommend getting this."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"After having used a Mid-2012 MacBook Pro and Mid-2011 Air for the last 8 years, I was ready to upgrade.  Did a lot of research and though I use my computer heavily, most of what I need to do can easily be done on the 2020 M1 Air.I waited for the sale and when $200 off came up, I snatch it up.  After having used it for just a few hours I have to say that it is incredible for the price!  I fully expect this machine to last 6 years or more."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"The body is made of aluminum, which feels higher quality than the best windows laptops I've used. The computer is really fast without heat and fan noise. It's such a delight to someone who, long ago surrendered that performance = fan noise. Thank you Apple for making the cooling fan obsolete! I normally use 32gb of Ram on Windows and do great with 8gb of Ram on the M1. As a life long Windows user, I recommend you try this laptop. You will truly be shocked by its performance."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"I bought this for my wife as I am a PC guy and this is a first impression review.  Like all things Apple, it is nice to look at with a sleek design and the screen that is sharp and clear.  I always read the negative reviews and a lot of folks complained there were no USB ports.  This isn't entirely true, it says it comes with 2 USB C ports and it does.  A simple thumb adapter ($5) is all you need to use a regular USB device.  HOWEVER, I was expected an SD card slot that is not there.  That was disappointing but, again, an adapter can solve that.  My wife loved the fact that almost as soon as she connected to our network, it almost instantly transferred everything from her phone and 10 year old MacBook.  So far, she is pleased with this purchase.  Additional items needed:  Clear protective cover and screen protector $16, adapters $10, MS Office Home for Mac, $149."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,It's what I expected to receive.
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,Good
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"This computer is very sleek and lightweight, it’s also very easy to use."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,I have this MacBook (in rose gold) and loved it so much that I got one for my hubby (space gray) for Christmas! it was such a good deal that I couldn't pass It up!
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,Came in original packaging. Works great for online school - just like I bought it from Apple but about $200 cheaper.
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,I loooooooive this MacBook but I need a mouse.  Can you show me one that is actually the same shade of “gold” … this isn’t really gold.  I love it but…I would like a mouse that matches.  The touch is wonderful and it’s my weird hand that needs a mouse.  Can someone match up this colour correctly?
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,Mi Mac esta hermosa como esperaba. La uso para diseño gráfico en Photoshop CC y va perfecta.
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"I purchased the rose gold color & I’m extremely pleased with my choice. It’s beautiful!  It arrived quickly, packaged perfectly & it was an easy setup! I had it up & running in no time. No issues or problems at all.  My son has used this same laptop (different color) for the past 4 years of college and it still works perfectly! You truly do get what you pay for! I will always buy Apple products."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"As many others have shared, the Apple MacBook Air M1 is a great laptop. The display is gorgeous. The keyboard is accurate and smooth. Apple has the best trackpads! Battery life is so good that there is no anxiety over having enough power to finish the day.The setup experience is so good with Apple products. All I had to do was choose my language and connect to wi-fi and then moments later the laptop was ready for me to login.The laptop integrates so well with the other Apple devices. Although I wonder why it wanted my iPhone's lock screen passcode. I am not sure how secure I feel that my iPhone's lock screen password is shared over the air with the laptop... Otherwise the MacBook Air is a great device for consuming content and for light-creative work."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,I needed to replace my  beloved 10 year old MacBook Air and I took advantage of the close-out pricing on the M1 2020 model. The transition was seamless...I love my NEW MacBook Air !
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,Productivity is high with this bad boy.
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"Love it, over over performs my old one in many aspect, battery can last much longer, much clear screen, very light weight, much more solid. No complains"
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,This is an amazing buy for what you get!! Lots of power on a small package. Great for gaming because of the second to none graphics capabilities!! Huge W if you buy this item!!
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,This MacBook was just as expected! And everything I needed! I loved that it came up very quickly as well
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"This is honestly an excellent machine.Not even interested in discussing ""cons"" because there aren't any if you  weigh up the price point fairly for what is arguably the best ultra portable laptop on the market right now (July 21') and I don't mean the fastest.The ""only two"" thunderbolt slots can be dongled out to the max. If you want a second or third monitor setup, get any ""display-link"" certified hub like the Dell 452-BCYT D6000 Universal Dock (pricey) or the WAVLINK USB 3.0 Universal Laptop Docking Station,USB C to 5K/ Dual 4K @60Hz Video (cheaper).The 7 cores of GPU on this model won't be noticed vs 8 cores. The machine is a beast. I'm using Lumafusion to process video (not even designed for MacOS but ports across from iPadOS) and it's 3X as fast as the iPad Pro that I own - 2019Best laptop I've ever owned and I've owned two earlier MacBook pro's, a Mac mini, several windows laptops, and the Dell S2721Q 27 Inch 4K UHD monitor I purchased here is parked on top of the last windows machine I purchased.The 4K dell monitor is easily crisp enough for MacOS and I purchased the keyboard used and Magic Mouse (2) new, on Amazon.It's been a while since I've been on MacOS and would describe it as wonderful to use and look at, after coming from windows 10. Sidecar is also amazing (using the iPad Pro to the right for that)If you're shopping for a laptop or a Mac laptop, this is a good option.You'll love it. Nuff said."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"I have always wanted a MacBook, ever since I was a little kid. But, there was always something that stopped me from getting one. They always mentioned that the Air wasn't very good, from 2011 all the way up to 2019, reviews always mentioned the multiple flaws MacBook Air had; from the thermal throttling, to the super small SSD (128 at base price), over $1000, then the Butterfly Keyboard etc. The list went on and on, and I really thought that it wasn't worth the money. Until, WWDC 2020, Apple announced they would start making their own chips straight from home, I was so excited for this new generation, it reminded me of the time when they went from PowerPC to Intel. The excitement was there, and I loved the new unibody that started in 2016, with the removal of unnecessary ports for the average Joe. Everything was the same, but the new M1 chip. That is when I realized that this M1 MacBook Air was the one for me. I didn't hesitate and started saving until I had enough to buy it. And, I absolutely made the best decision in purchasing it. It is amazing, it's super slim. portable, super fast processing speed and power. The screen is beautiful, the bezels are unnoticeable. The keyboard is outstanding, To be completely honest, this laptop makes you want to be more productive, just because of its speed and its ease of use. If you're thinking about purchasing a Mac, this by far is one of the better choices (and the cheapest nonetheless) The charger is also outstanding! 30w is all you need for this little thing."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"I have used PCs since the 1980s. I have an iPhone and love it so I decided to try the move from PC to Mac. I love my new MacAir. The speed is incredible, the screen is beautiful, and I'm getting used to the operating system. I will keep learning because there are so many good things about Apple, I've just scratched the surface. No matter how long you've used a PC, if you choose a Mac, you'll never go back!"
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,My new MacBook Air is just what I was looking for as a home computer. I use one for work and needed one for home. I like the finger touch sign in.
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,Came from using a dell…. Very different… great at holding a charge… not touch screen so that’s something to get use to.
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"We bought the laptop in Dec 2021. After a couple of weeks, it had a big OS update: Big Sur to Monterey. The problems started happening - I kept getting locked out, passwords not working, account name not working - resulting to my having to run to the Mac Service Center 2x.The first time they said the update caused some issues. Second one said, it was a file vault issue.Also, noticed how since the update my battery life has decreased. The tech guys said this is normal after an update due to the machine still settling and should stabilize soon. It's been a couple of weeks and still the same. I've even heeded the advice of not logging out nor shutting down, just folding the laptop, to let the machine keep working on the kinks. Also because it's an M1 technology so no need to formally shut it down like a PC.Not sure of what's really going on, tbh.Perhaps it is due to Apples newest OS being buggy, or it could be the unit is a lemon. Not sure. But giving it one last chance and if it fails me again before the 90 day warranty is up, I am returning it."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,After hearing good reviews from my sister who has been a MacBook owner for MANY years I decided to scoop this one up when it went on sale. Man am I glad I did. Lightning fast and I know it will last (hopefully) many years to come!
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,Bought this new Apple MacBook Air for my wife who had just retired and who could really enjoy using it.Great Apple quality!
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"Love it, came charged a little and within the delivery time! Definitely recommend!"
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"I love this little computer! When I was looking for a laptop to buy, I almost went with a used, older MacBook Air. I decided to just spend the extra money and get a brand new computer and the newest model and I’m so happy I did because Apple’s M1 chip is impressive. After two months of owning this laptop, I think my favorite thing is the battery life. For lighter tasks (web browsing, listening to music, steaming Netflix etc), the battery could last the entire day, and I love how I can take this thing anywhere with me without having to lug a charger around as well. For heavier tasks, it of course doesn’t last all day but you get a lot of hours out of the battery. It rarely gets hot, and doesn’t even have a fan, so you know how efficient that chip is running. I also love the fanless design because I can have it with me in my bed or anywhere and not worry about blocking vents or getting dog hair in those fans. I don’t use it for anything crazy, mainly just work and personal stuff, along with frequent streaming and occasionally I’ll fire up the Sims 4 (and it runs beautifully by the way). But I’m never not impressed by how quick it is, opens applications almost instantly and wakes instantly. Also, I am new to Mac with this purchase but have owned iPhones for a decade and I love the seamless integration jumping between applications on your laptop and phone. So far I’m loving Big Sur and basically this is just a laptop that would be great for almost anyone."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"I’ve been very happy with this MacBook and it’s integration with my my iPhone, iPad and Mac accessories.  It’s light weight but feels substantial with the aluminum frame and the keyboard is crisp and responsive for a compact laptop."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"Took my chance and bought one used off Amazon warehouse deals. It's brand new except the warranty has only a few months left. Can't complain at all! This computer is awesome as I upgraded from 2013 Macbook Pro Retina. It's way faster. But 8GB of ram will be slow at times, and the laptop gets hot during summer months. Also the trackpad has a tendency of dragging instead of clicking when you're clicking around really fast. Like when you're trying to get that hot concert ticket, and you click really fast on Ticketmaster, it drags the text or link instead of clicking on it like it should which causes a second of two of delay. I hope they get this fixed but it's unlikely they will ever notice this. Most people don't use trackpad to click as fast as me."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,Great dependable computer bought for my niece who is a junior in high school and wanted a computer that will go to college with her

Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"Love the product, bought a laptop for the first time in 5 year, couldn’t be happier with this product. Amazing."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,I love how light and compact it is while still having some very good punch to it
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,I got a good deal
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,So for the most part I use this for when I am traveling or out and about for my business. I find it the right size for the job I am doing and take advantage of Apples cloud storage and ways of using other Mac's as storage for information so this doesn't use storage much at all. Where this is nice is the quick user functionality it has in access these documents or programs needed seamlessly and being able to help keep my business moving on the road. Most of the time I am using browser programs to access the business info or using the cloud to access files back at the home base which is the new Mac Mini with an external hard drive that houses the business information. I find that the size makes a great traveling companion for onsite work. When connecting to a shared internet connection it is nice knowing that the channel is mostly secure and when using my iPhone shares cell connection and new chips they can help create a safe network for my means of work. If you are debating getting one for business I recommend using their cloud storage so you eliminate the focus on storage anxiety and makes it more worth it in the long run of having a user interface focused laptop. Also the battery for most of the work I am doing lasts me a week with heavy workload 4 days max. Honestly you can't get too much better for a long lasting Apple hardware focused product.
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"Esta Mac fue un regalo a mi madre y por velocidad, calidad de video y sobretodo por su diseño compacto y ergonómico le encanta llevarla a todos lados"

Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"A well executed little machine that arrived promptly and in excellent condition.  For the price, I don’t mind being a generation behind"
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,I love that it didn’t come in broken or anything they put protection in with the packaging but it really does depend on the ups driver
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"This is my 1st time purchasing a mac computer. My only complaint with this computer is not touch screen. It took me about a few hours to learn how to navigate the system. The battery life, processing system and the weight of the computer is superb. The price tag is worth it, but even better when you wait for a sale."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,The silver color looks good
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"It’s a mac air. It’s cheaper than going to apple directly.UPDATE: trackpad is scrolling and clicking uncontrollably, if I minimize a window it makes an error sound repeatedly until I pull it back up and the space bar has a mind of its own. Will never purchase apple products thru Amazon again."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,This laptop was a disgrace! It last only a year we take it to Best Buy they told my son to bring it to Apple but they said it will cost almost the same amount of money to buy a new one. I dindon trust Apple anymore I suggested him to buy a dell laptop instead. This was a gift to my son that graduated from high school with honor going to college I felt so honored for the grade that he graduated with. Sadly it was a waste of money. It’s so sad now a day people spending more money and get poor quality of thing
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,I’ve been wanting to switch from my pc. Everything else I own is Apple. When the prime day price popped up I couldn’t resist. It is definitely a learning curve but fairly easy to get used to. As far as I can see I don’t need to add any programs. I was able to migrate everything from my PC and this baby is FAST!
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,I’ve only been using my MacBook Air for a few weeks now but it’s already the best purchase I’ve made in a long time. I was debating getting either a windows or an apple computer and decided in the end to get this MacBook Air. The screen itself is amazing and I love how smooth the keyboard types. And as someone who has a phone and an iPad it’s so convenient having all my devices synced up. Highly recommend!
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"Was excited to finally open my MacBook. Took out of the brown apple box, then took wrapping off of the white box. Slowly let it open like the awesome packaging does.. then boom! Smells like mold/mildew… Tried thinking it was the box, closed it up, with computer and charger out. Computer fired right up, the power cord seems to be the smelly part. When I unwrapped it it left a sticky residue only my hands and the room just smells of moldy mildew. Not the apple experience I expected…"
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"I own a business(photography business) and first and foremost being able to travel lightly but efficiently was key.  The MBA is an amazing little tool for the form factor that it is.  It is a quick little machine with ZERO noise.  Can you believe that?  Stick with me and I will try and keep it simple enough.  Processing power is ""decent"".  It does not wow me, especially with graphics intensive workflows like Lightroom, Photoshop and Panoramic building.  Everything else it works just as intended and no real hiccups.  Being that my business is in the creative realm I import a TON of data via USB and the macbook air's inputs.  I must say I am completely up in arms with the inputs in this decive and would imagine the inputs in the Macbook Pro would operate in the same fashion.For instance it took almost 1 hour to input a 64gb SD card.  For real?  This is appalling and do believe there is something inhibiting the performance of this transfer as the cards write at 90mb/s.-Pros-Small Form FactorSilentDecent Processing PowerLight-Cons-Onboard Graphics very low spec2 IO PortsExtremely slow IO ports for being ""USB 4.0""If the USB inputs were better Id give this a 5 star.  When importing data it is just abysmal."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,Went from a 2011 to this! Love it!
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,Came as expected in a sealed box and package. Something about a new laptop that makes you feel so motivated to tackle all your tasks. Nothing beats a new Macbook
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,Not sure where these laptops were stored but the musty smell was overpowering when I opened up the box.  The main culprit was the power cord.  I went online to find a solution and found multiple complaints about this model’s cord.  LOVE the computer….hate the cord smell.  Luckily it stays charged so long that I can put it in another room to charge every 3rd day.
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,I love how lite it is and it’s so cute. Love the brightness and the design
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"This is my first macbook and thank you for changing the shipping restrictions, I was able to buy one. I am still adjusting with the keyboard and the OS coming from a long time windows user. The battery life is amazing. Better than my windows laptop. Hopefully I can buy the higher specs next time, I don't mind paying the tax. I originally wanted to get the 16gb ram and 1tb storage, but it doesn't ship to my location. And thanks for the fast shipping."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"I got it as a gift for my wife and she loves it. Though I'm not into the Apple eco, I am really impressed by the build, popping screen, and sleekness. I guess those are the general expectations.If Linux is not a must for you, I really recommend you go for the Macs.Shipping and handling were on point."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"I’ve had it for less than 24 hrs and this is my first MacBook so my assessment is short. One word : QUALITY. The look, the feel, the essence….all of it screams EXCELLENCE."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,This 13.3” MacBook Air is awesome!! Way better than my HP. Very happy with this purchase.
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,Para uso básico en casa es super cómoda de buen tamaño y tiene todo lo que requiero.
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"What I liked: Apple's construction quality is second to none. Unboxing this is a delight, it's just a beautiful machine. You can start working with it as soon as the initial setup is done, which might take a few minutes. Love the display, bright colors, nice resolution, everything looks crisp. Keys are a delight to type with, real smooth. Battery life is the best I've ever witnessed, I just recharge this thing every other day, whereas my previous laptop would use three rounds of charge a day (and I had for just one year).What I disliked: some of my favorite apps are still not ready for Apple Silicon or M1 chip. It's given me two or three random reboots with cryptic error logs already. And coming from over 25 years using mostly Windows (and some 2-3 years using Linux) I feel like I have to rewire my brain to start using the fn, control, option & command keys properly.All in all, it's a really solid laptop although I feel like I still haven't made the most out of it. No heavy usage so far, except for some minor audio production work. Guess I'll do it eventually. Hope app compatibility gets better with time too, that's the reason for the missing star up there, otherwise, it would've been 5-stars all the way."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,have no complaints. delivery was fast too.
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"I've had and used iPhones from the beginning and had iPads since the iPad 2 but this is my very first Mac and I thought it might be a lot to learn this OS but things were familiar cuz I've used and owned iPads and iPhones.  I'm still having to learn a few things and had to Google questions on how to do somethings but it's been a good experience.  I really didn't expect that.  I love the OS BIG SUR and now can't wait to the next OS.  I only got 256gb cuz I didn't know if I would like this plus I knew i had to learn the OS.  Now, I'm waiting for the M2 Mac Book Pro, i plan to invest a lot more money into that one now I know that I like the Apple OS.  Looking at getting 2tb 32gigs of ram!  I like that it runs the apps from iOS or iPadOS!  I wish the screen was better though.  I'm talking at least mini-led but would prefer OLED for what I use it for.  Battery life is amazing! Camera quality sucks.  Come on Apple, give us the 2021 M1 iPad Pro camera and stop being so cheap!I'm happy with my purchase.  I will probably give this to my mom when the M2 MacBook Pro comes out!"
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"I've worked on and serviced Macs for many years, but I've never considered purchasing one for the price. Macs have never been a good value. I wanted a $1000 laptop, and my choices quickly narrowed to this. It has the best laptop processor and the best screen money can buy, especially at this price. The battery life on MacBooks is always good, so I knew that wouldn't be an issue.After purchase, I've come to the same conclusions. The screen is wonderful. Bright and high res, excellent color accuracy. The M1 processor speed has blown me away with its performance. I don't need much RAM or Storage, so I'm still happy with that. I do wish for more RAM, but I don't necessarily need it for my work I do. What has blown my mind more than anything else is the battery life. I've never had a laptop like this. I don't have to carry a charger with me anymore: the MacBook easily handles a full day of charge. I also like the fact that it doesn't have a fan. I don't have to worry about thermals when getting comfy in my bed and doing some light work.Overall, best laptop I've ever purchased. I've had no issues over more than a month of ownership, and I'm super picky about tech as well as slightly anti-Apple, so I've basically converted because of this machine."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"Muy buen producto. Excelente calidad audio sonido y gráficos, perfecta laptop para estudiante , para jugar sólo juegos para Mac , por lo demás perfecta"
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,Perfect laptop for a prefect price
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,Great laptop with excellent battery Life!
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,Great price for this MacBook. This replaced an old HP laptop. It’s easy to navigate. Small and compact for carrying around if needed.
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,Decent laoptop but PCs offer greater functionality for the $1K+ price tag. Performance and speed average when considering the price.
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"I was scared jumping from my 2020 MBP-16 to a MB-Air.  But I wanted lighter and figured I could carry both if I need the power of my Pro.  Ummmm, I don't need my Pro.  This thing blows my almost brand new Intel based MBP!  Now, there have been some anomalies with different apps and things.  No show stoppers.  But you can clearly tell which apps were updated for the M1 and which weren't  They work fine, but take a several seconds to open.One process I use it for is livestreaming our church services using OBS, and iPhone and a USB Audio device for the feed from the mixer.  All of this is streamed only to FB Live and recorded on machine.  On the MBP, this all worked fine, but the battery couldn't keep up, even plugged in.  Had the same issue on my 2018 MBP 13"".  But the M1 does all of this without any issues from a power perspective.  Plus, it's much more stable for this use than the MBP.  I would get a lot of sticking video on the MBP and have, so far, received none on the M1.Very happy with the price too.  But, get as much memory and disk space as you can afford.  Can't have too much."

Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,Perfect size to carry anywhere!  I love this small laptop. The screen quality is great and touch screen is easy to use!
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,I want to write my memoirs for my 15 Grandchildren and 5 Great Grandchildren.
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"Great laptop for my daughter - she uses Apple Arcade to play games for a low monthly price. The inclusion of productivity apps is great for school as well, and ‘Find My’ feature allows us to worry less if she misplaced for a bit."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"I jumped out of the “Ecosystem” a little while back. Last had a MacBook Pro 13” in about 2015 when we had real ports. I realize those days aren’t coming back and it’s #HubLife or #NoLife. But I’ve been underwhelmed with Apples offerings for a minute.When I started reading up and watching vids on the new M1 I was sold. I’m all in now. This Air is an absolute unit of a machine. I really see no reason for anyone to get the Pro, unless you’re getting the soon to be released updated 16” pro. This bad boy will do all that most people need.Let me say first off, the battery life is phenomenal. I can take it on the go and use it all day with no issues at all. I didn’t even pack my charger with me today. I can carry it in a simple sleeve and I’m good to go. Plus it’s lighter than the pro as well.Performance is spectacular. It runs circles around anything else I have that’s windows based. In testing, I’ve seen it surpass or hold its own, against prior MacBook Pro models. Even those with dedicated graphics.For the majority of people, this is going to be their go to laptop. What you get for an entry level Mac is stellar. This is my recommendation for anyone outside of a hardcore video/photo editor. But even then, in a pinch it will get the job done."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"I received this as a Christmas gift 4 months ago and have used it at home since. It was never dropped or in anyway handled roughly and sat in the same place on my table. Yesterday it developed horizontal lines throughout the display.  When I called customer service they were very helpful and set up an appointment with the repair desk on 14 th street in Manhattan. The guy there took a look and said that the MacBook was “damaged” that the display was cracked under the glass, and the repair would cost $500.When I explained that NOTHING had happened to the computer but the Apple guy first suggested that my dog did it. He then said it could have been caused by closing it on a cord.  That is at least theoretically possible though I in fact did not close a cord in there. The damage he pointed to was not anywhere near the hinge where a cord might cause pressure, but at the top of the screen where closing would cause the least pressure if a cord were in the way.  All I know is that one morning the display was screwed up.  Later,  when I wiped the screen with a piece of cloth to try and photograph the 1/2 inch crack, it extended down screen and the display went black.If the computer can be damaged by being closed, it violates New York’s implied warranty of merchantability, matter how much Apple tries to avoid standing behind its incredibly crappy product.I would be interested in forming a class action based on the fact that this flimsy product does not perform the functions of a laptop computer."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"I needed a new computer desperately, (screen broke and volume malfunctioned on my beloved old Asus transformer), so after much research about Macs online, I ordered a new MacBook Air. Most of the online reviews and info praised it except for the camera, and in this current pandemic Zoom world, that was a must!  However, I couldn't imagine a new apple  computer having a worse camera than my old iPhone 6 which I am still happily using, so I took a chance! The laptop is awesome on so many levels! New M1 chip, super fast everything, and fantastic color display!The sound and yes, the camera, are phenomenal! I can only assume the bad camera reviews were made by video bloggers that need extreme HD resolution. I just do average work on my computer, so no problem there! I am thoroughly enjoying surfing online, streaming videos, and Zooming with great clarity. I needed to clarify this camera issue for those holding back from purchasing such a great computer just due to those negative camera opinions, as I was. If I had read my review or one similar to it, it would have eased my mind. So, unless you're a vlogger , fear not!It's a fantastic computer in every sense of the word! (Not to mention the $999 price for a new Mac!) Get it!!! You won't regret it! The rose gold is especially pretty!"
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,must buy
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"Received it yesterday in the morning and I love it! The only negative thing I have to say is that it doesn't bring any USB ports. It's the newer version so make sure to get adapters. But overall, couldn't be happier!"
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,Good purchase with discount.Save 200 dollars and quality is the best.
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,Exellent! Thanks a lot!
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,The light weight and screen touch.  Personal
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,Just like the laptop
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"It’s a standard Mac, there are no bells and whistles. If you’ve owned a Mac of any kind before, there’s nothing new here.It’s about 15% faster than the Intel version, however on some apps it might be slower or exactly the same.The Retina screen sort of works but only on apps that support Retina. Otherwise, it scales back to 1440x900.The build quality is not very good and it’s easy to break.I had mine for 5 days and the keyboard keys stopped working, or work intermittently.Also, it does not use MagSafe, so there’s a possibility you can knock your MacBook Air by tripping on the charging cable.It also doesn’t support USB-A, so you’ll have to buy an adapter."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,I love this MacBook but the only thing is that my caps lock doesn't work well I try to turn it on and doesn't work unless I hit it in the right spot.
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"I have used Microsoft Windows based computers 100% since 1985.  Now for the 1st time I decided to try Apple out instead to see how Windows compares to a MacBook.  Only been a few days and I already see things unfamiliar I am learning. So far...I have to say the speed of the new M1 processor compared to any of the Windows 10 computers is very impressive and just the speed and ""faster response"" the MacBook seems to have combined with the programs I have downloaded and a few I purchased I would have to say I prefer the MacBook.  I added a 7 port USB hub and a trackball I use instead of the built in pad but other then that I have not changed a thing.  It definitely does everything I need it to do both business related an for pleasure.  I also enjoy the small portable size and will be taking it on it's first trip in just a few days.  If anyone is a current Windows user and is considering the switch to try out a MacBook I would say go for it and do not look back....If you purchase one and later decide you would prefer not to stick with it a MacBook seems to hold their value much better then the majority of Windows based computers out there."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"First off: this computer is extremely lightweight, well built, and beautiful. Yes this is the new MacBook Air M1. And it arrived with 4 days after shipping (bad weather slowed it down so it arrived late).Battery: I’ve been on my computer for 12 hours today and battery is at 64%. I’ve had it for 3 days. And have only charged it once.  And that was when it arrived while I set up.  The computer is very quiet it and does not get hot. I’ve had several tabs open and applications at once and it didn’t even slow down or run hot.Camera: FaceTime calls are beautiful on here. Facebook messenger, you look a little yellow, but other people look perfect(probably lighting issue)Sound: is amazing, the best I have had on any computer. Crystal clear sound. This computer gets really loudSpeed: this computer is extremely fast.  Internet sites load with a second. As soon as you sign in it’s an instant log on to your screen with no waiting for application to load.This by far the best computer I’ve had. If you are looking at your first MacBook laptop this is great(this is my first also). If you are looking to upgrade a really old MacBook model you will love this. Worth the money!"
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"This item was described as having cosmetic damages but after having it for 8 months, I can't tell that it was ever used by anybody else. Came exactly as advertised and has been the best laptop I've ever owned."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"Likes: happy wifeBut seriously, I’m not a MacOS user, personally, but my wife is and she loves it. Her old 2012 Macbook Pro could finally be put to rest.These machines last a LONG time. The battery life easily lasts her two full days of use (probably around 15 hours).As a nurse, she’s constantly looking up new techniques or reviewing current literature, so her next laptop needed to be power-efficient, but powerful.The M1 does just that.The screen quality is second to none as you can expect from Apple products.This particular mac (2020 MacBook Air M113”) does NOT have the touchbar that thePros do — and we’re glad! It felt out of place when we were trying out the new lineup of Macs.This Air also has the “new” keyboard— which is just Apple going back to their old style of chiclet keyboard—a fan favorite.Also, this Air never gets hot. This is something new to me as I’m used to devices running too hot after long usage, but the Air’s M1 is so efficient the laptop doesn’t need a fan!"
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,Great battery life and overall performance! If you need compact yet fast laptop there is no better choice.
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"bought macbook after using windows for 15 years, it's amazing"
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,Not a touch screen but has a beautiful picture that's easy to read off of. Perfect for my needs!
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,Works fine. As expected. Arrived very well packaged and was super easy to set up.
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,My sister just graduated high school and my Papa decided to get her a computer for her in college. She wanted this one and she says it is awesome! Does everything she needs it to for school!
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"The laptop is very thin it’s good quality, it came with everything needed. It works perfectly nothing wrong with this computer 10/10 would recommend. App runs smoothly there are no problems with this computer."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,Excelent delivery and product
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"This product is not cheap, it's not something that you normally could just drop loads of money on... good job if you can.Take students perspective. Not much to my name and obviously in desperate need of something that can at least operate. Sure you can opt for something cheaper if you want something that just ""works"", however, if you want something that can get the job done, is reliable, absolutely beautiful, and long lasting that can beat any other laptop out of the park with the M1 processor... I'd suggest you get this laptop now.Stop thinking about it honestly, just do it. Two days ago I was sitting here debating for so long if I should even go for it finally somehow having the funds. Regretting doing so even after placing my order. All that went away when I held this near magical product in my hands for the first time. You will never have to buy another laptop again for a long time if you simply take care of it. It's going to take me a long way into my education... as will it you and what you chose to use it for.Happy M1'ing be productive!"
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"I looked at a lot of different laptops and went to my local Best Buy for in person testing before deciding on this one.  I work from home and have been using a older model HP that was passed down to me that had a hour and a half battery life, a plastic shell, and froze endlessly.This laptop is real clean looking, feels solid, has insane battery life, and the screen is absolutely insane.  Watching videos on it is unreal and have had no issues running multiple programs/desktops/and some gaming on it.  I purchased the base model and run it with an external hard drive to keep the space clear on it.I love how all the apple products interact seamlessly with each other and the sidecar feature that links it to the iPad to work as a second screen on the go.In the future would be nice to see the bezels slimmed down, the keyboard have a little more weight to it, MacBook Air speakers amped up a bit, and a higher quality camera and all those things are near perfect.  Ill be holding on to this for the next 5 years plus"
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,I am so impressed  cause when I just sow the price I said noway but its fantastic really am happy and this is coming from a android person don't think a lot just get it
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"It’s not my first MacBook, and the quality of it is up to standards.  My issue is that I bought it in June of 2022, and it says it was produced in 2020.  The title is misleading, it makes you think that it’s 2020 model.  I hoped it wasn’t sitting on the shelf for two years, but looks like it was."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"Replaced a 10 year old MacBook pro (spinning harddrive, one-hour batter life, spinning beach balls).  Updates are smooth and backing up is seamless.  Able to set it up to limit the tech to just what she needs (right click, what does that do?).  She was very hesitant to get a new computer, as her old one ""works"".  6 months later, she said she wouldn't go back.  Its light with a for-ever battery life.  Thanks, Apple!"
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"Arrived in excellent condition, completely unscratched. Everything works as intended."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,The best from the best!
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"pants received, good quality no words, is what I want, really good, very valuable, cost-effective, good, all five points!"
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"I've had this for two days and it's the fastest thing I've ever touched. But for my specific purposes, this laptop is the ideal."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,for personal
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"I was weary about getting a MacBook because my friends and sources told me it was inconvenient. But I just needed it for college, and it's doing a perfect job. I love this thing so much. I don't do much on it besides watching YouTube, listening to music, and typing essays. Maybe that's why I have had no issues. Battery lasts FOREVER. I would recommend this if you need a day-to-day laptop. With other things, I have no comment."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"Update: 5 stars to 2 starsI started seeing a lot of faint gray lines on my screen. Took it to the Apple store for inspection and was told it could be an internal wiring issue. If you are considering buying used, make sure you thoroughly inspect the device you receive. Most of the devices end up at the returns due to a reason.—————-I was shopping around for a M1 air, but found the cheapest here in Amazon. I pulled the trigger since the price was too good to pass. Though the listing stated Good condition and could have minor scratches and dents, fortunately I got a device that was Like New. There were 2 very minor scratches at the bottom. The device also had apple Warranty for the rest of 2023, and came with only 13 power cycles. Haven’t stress tested the device yet. But I hope with the Apple warranty I should be able to get things fixed."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,I replaced on older 2009 MacBook Pro with this new model from Apple. It has the new M1 chip and it is fast. For the type of things I do in a home office this is lightning fast. I don't do a lot of editing of videos or play video games on it so my work load is pretty mundane compared to others. I like it though because it is lightweight when I take it to my den or on a trip in my computer bag. The battery lasts a long time and the keyboard is very responsive. Love the screen clarity. I have not found any of my regular apps having any difficulty running on the new chip. I did set up a new camera connection app to see how it would do and had no issues either. It is running in the background and when they update to work specifically with the new chip it should work even better. I don't have any negatives with this computer. I have been an Apple fan for several years now and so use to it that I have great difficulty when trying to use a Window's based computer.
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,Best choice overall for the average user.
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"I bought this MBA for my wife for Valentine's Day, and she has been in love with it ever since. She thinks it was the best Vday gift that she has gotten in years, it does everything so well!"
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,Similar to my 2012 model that I loved. Everything transferred over seamlessly.  Hopefully this lasts just as long!
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,Everything works beautifully.My previous macbook lasted 14 years (it still works fine). i hope this one will exceed that.
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"I can do so much at once on this awesome computer. def great for work and school. not great for gaming, but you can do a lil."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"I've had at least half a dozen mac laptops and as a non-pro the air is just what I needed. I replaced a Macbook Pro with the touch bar, the only Mac I've had which failed on me, and when I saw the price of new Macbook Pros I about fainted. I don't do graphics or video, I don't play games, I figured I'd just try the basic Macbook Air and see if it was fast enough. Bingo, it's great. New M1 processor is plenty for web surfing, daily use of the full MS Office suite with multiple windows open at the same time, video streaming etc. Battery life is terrific, I can work all day on a single charge! Sure there are people who need a ""Pro"" device but for the vast majority of us, even heavy daily usage, this is a spectacular computer."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,Love it!
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,Perfect!  I loved it.
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"I wanted a new MacBook since it's been several years since I got my last Mac and the battery was going bad.With a delicious gold color and an overall thin, sleek design, this computer is for those who want their computer to look a bit more ""fancy"" than other options on the market.With the M1 chip, everything is extremely fast. I was able to set up this new machine with 10 minutes.I am not sure if I would recommend this machine to those who have recently upgraded to a Mac (2017 to now) but if it's been several years and you want to splurge, go for this.As a writer, the keyboard is so smooth and I feel like I can type more words per minute on this machine.My only complaint is the webcam, while better, is still not up to par to other computer cameras on the market. FaceTime looks a bit grainy still and Photo Booth is just a joke. The quality barely looks different than recent models.Overall, this is a great addition to the Mac family. I look forward to see how Apple utilizes the M1 chip in the future.83/100"
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,Perfect for work!!

Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,Just got it setup. Replaces an old Mac Mini I’ve had for several years. Really pleased so far! Very smooth and fast operation!
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,This works fine but I had to buy separate adapter to read thumb drives. Also bought  external hard drive and DVD player. All the extras run up the overall price.
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"Buying into the Apple ecosystem should only be done to make products for the ecosystem which will make the user money, but, do not make them a critical part of your workflow.  They are too expensive for that.  Apple just does not make good computers.  Yes, they make a OK operating system, but they make computers that cannot be repaired by taking out the ssd or ram sticks and putting new ones in.You can't just go and buy the parts to fix your Mac computers when they break.  The MacBook Air is no exception to this.  The SSD is solider to the motherboard.  Likewise the RAM.  Now, if that were the only problem, well -- one would be able to get someone skilled to replace these broken pieces after Apple stop warranty coverage -- maybe.  But, they don't even allow the suppliers of these chips to supply them to the public.  So, once the warranty is. up -- you will not be able to get spare parts for the computer.  Needless to say, this is a major flaw in Apple products -- of which it is no exception for this MacBook Air.  (Oh, and if they start allowing suppliers to supply, but, lock down with crypto keys to a particular machine we just have even more e-waste.)Also, this computer flickers with a 4K output.  The MacBook Air has screen flicker with an external monitor using the HooToo dock that I've used with an Intel MacBook Pro which is a few years old.  This is unacceptable.  Apple's response to the sometimes frying the computer for using USB-C docks that work with other computers is an example of the poorly built computer they are pushing.Though poorly engineered in terms of video, ssd, and RAM.  It is a wonderful typing experience when using the laptop keyboard.  If you are willing to let that guide you, then, the computer may be worth it if you are willing to set aside another grand when ssd fails or you plug in the wrong dock to drive an external monitor even though someone else just had their Intel Mac plugged in and worked just fine.  (Supposedly Apple fix this with an OS update -- good for them.)Even though I dislike the Mac, it is better than most laptops -- because it is quiet since it has no fan.  Would I buy one again? Perhaps -- it is a question of whether I think the market exists for me to make money off of it.The good things:Keyboard, touchpad, Built-In Screen, Build-In Speakers, Drives External Audio better than Microsoft Windows, and the Operating System is less cluttered than is Windows.  Also, comes with a Spreadsheet, Word Processor, Presentation Program -- now, it is better just to use something really Libre -- like LibreOffice.  But, it is kind of nice the table steaks are included -- unlike for Microsoft Windows."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"I was a bit skeptical of everyone saying how great the M1 Air is. I’ve been using a Windows gaming PC with an i7 9700k processor and 16 gigs of ram for audio production with a lot of amp simulators (processor intensive) and sample libraries (ram intensive). I needed to be able to create music on the go and I wasn’t sure the M1 was up for the task since desktop processors perform better than mobile processors. Boy was I wrong. I reached more than double the amount of amp sims as my desktop PC could do and was still only at 50% processor usage! These ARM processors are so much more efficient than Intel so if you’re looking to do audio production on the go, the M1 is the way to go. I do wish I got the 1tb or 2tb though to avoid needed to keep an external hard drive plugged in though so get as much storage as you can possibly afford"
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"This arrived exactly as i expected. I live in Jamaica and this product was shipped straight to me. It arrived perfectly packaged without even the slightest scratch or blemish. Just know that if you were to purchase this product you are getting exactly what you expected. It works. No hiccups or hangups. It's just fast, smooth and a premium looking laptop. I cant say enough good things about this device. Just take care of it and trust that you will have a working computer for the next decade or more.  Get it!!"
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"I have had my new MacAir not quite two weeks and it is even better than I expected.  This one is with the new M1 chip and is an upgrade from my previous Mac....which I loved.  Faster, better, more battery.  What's not to like.  And frankly the price for the machine is a bargain.  I do not use my Mac for gaming, heavy downloads, large graphics so can't comment but is why the Air is a perfect choice over the Pro.  Transferring files etc from my previous Mac was a snap and now I have my ""old"" Mac on the M1 so everything works better.  I was a bit surprised everything is the same size and weight....but that's likely because I didn't look at those specs before purchase.  One sweet thing about the Mac is it comes about 70% charged so just open and start.  If you are considering a Mac or have one and are thinking about upgrade just do it.  And Amazon made it easy....arrived in two days."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,Best of the best
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"Love the Apple MacBook Air affordable price than paying $1,000 for any computer"
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"100% brand new, sealed with all its plastic coverings and everything. Turned it on and so far so good. Arrived in time and in perfect condition. Thanks!"
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"Amazing quality from Apple. I was very sad to see some macbook airs go stray the past few years. Apple finally came back to its roots and built this masterpiece of a laptop. I have been a windows and mac user over the years, mostly being on windows. But the m1 has made it possible for me to make a complete transition. After going through laptops year after year, breaking down, and becoming outdated. I feel confident with m1 as my daily driver and I can run windows on it. Absolutely amazing. No reason to buy any other laptop right now."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,The best laptop I've used in years. You won't regret it.
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,The media could not be loaded.
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"This is a great product, but don’t buy from them because I did and some of the keys don’t press in all the way. It still inputs but you have to press a few times and it’s annoying for a $1,000 computer. In conclusion I think you should buy just do it though Apple directly. And maybe this isn’t even the best option for you there are tons of cheap chromebooks and stuff that might be better."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,I jumped from a 2010 model MacBook to thisI got the 256 fb 8gb model I produce music and honestly it’s been able to handle all of my plug ins and sound packs with ease...the touch buttons for the sound and brightness buttons are a much better practical way to go then the Touch Bar On the Mac Pro screen quality is solid and it’s really fast and smoothIf you have any doubts for buying this over the pro don’t doubt it...it’s extremely quiet and to be honest one music session I had was about 5 hours straight and the laptop was barely a little warm after all of that editing and recording on Logic Pro x....if you can afford it....it’s worth it....the only thing I think that I’m annoyed with it the fact that apple is still using a 720p webcam....it feels really lazy to me that I’m 2021 they chose to go with a 720p I think if they fixed that the laptop would be perfect
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,First MacBook. Everything Runs Smoothly. Battery Life Is Also Excellent. No Complaints.
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,Brand new & i love it
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"The screen quality is very clear. I don’t have the touchscreen ability; I thought it was included in this model. I only have the option for fingerprint passwords. The battery life is about 6-8 hours before it needs a charge. After about six hours, the battery seems to decrease quickly. I am only using the basic features, no gaming or any advanced programs. It does not have the 18 hours as suggested; that is very disappointing, As now I have to carry a charger in the event the battery decreases significantly."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"I decided to take a chance with MacOS and the at the time of purchase discounted Macbook Air. At first, I liked it a lot and was very impressed. However, over time, I quickly grew to dislike how strict MacOS is with installing things like an overbearing parent. While I personally didn't find this to be the laptop of choice, I cannot deny the excellent screen, insane battery life and great keyboard. The usage of the Macbook Air is too limited for what I use computers for, but for people with more basic needs or that use productivity apps constantly, it's an excellent selection. It just wasn't the all-rounded I had hoped it would be."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"I really like this MacBook Air. I thought about waiting for the next redesigned model but my iPad Pro battery is going and I wanted to update my laptop. I thought it would work more like my iPad, but it’s kind of like a Windows computer but opposite. I am having to look up how to do some things on it but I’m getting the hang of it. So far the battery life is great. It is light and fast. It would be nice if the WebCam was 1080 instead of 720 but since the screen is small the pictures OK using zoom."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,this version is bestseller!!!!
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"every older generation is practically the same, if you are interested in getting any mac the macbook air late 2015 model will fit all your needs and if cleaned properly will work like new. all airs can last extremely long. good quality laptop M1 chip is very powerful but 90% of users wont be able to use this mac to its full capacity honestly. But if you looking for an upgrade this is it, beautiful look, sleek design, light, powerful. will last from freshman year of college to well in post grad career. i say every mac with proper care can last a good 5-6 years then should be handed down to a friend. I gave my last mac book air (2015) away when I got this and my friends says the best laptop they ever had. again only mac worth buying new if you already own one and want to upgrade, 90% of those who will use it wont need the power and capacity it comes with."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,M1 air still the best choice for most of users
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,love it
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"This is my first Mac. It was not hard to get used to it as the laptop itself works great and has all the features needed. The battery life is extreme. Way longer than I expected. it also charges real quick. Nice that it uses a USB C plug to charge, it can be plugged in at any USB C plug. The only thing is that it only has two USB C ports. No SD or micro SD reader. I used an external Seagate hard drive with my windows laptop and now use it with the mac, just had to download free software from Seagate. The hard drive has 2 USB A ports that I can use to connect some of my devices that don't have a USB C plug. But this MacBook Air is super cool. The camera and microphone have great picture and sound quality. I have not even had a need to use my external Blue mic yet."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"Caveats: This is a Mac, so like any other, software choice can be limited. It's also the new ARM/M1 chip, so certain programs haven't caught up (as of early 2021), especially virtualization (VMWare, VirtualBox) and languages (Haskell).  This is a 13-inch screen, so screen real estate is limited, I couldn't recommend this as a ""daily driver"", except maybe for school/university.  Probably a great option if you're frequently on Google Meet or Zoom.Overall: amazing battery life; unmatched 3D power for the size & price; gorgeous screen with no color/brightness lost when tilted nor LCD configuration needed to optimize color, white/black levels; Mac OS Big Sur is constantly fast and responsive with smooth animation regardless of what is open/running.I've bought a lot of laptops, but this one surprisingly nice.  If you have to have Windows, or have to stay $1000, get a Microsoft Surface (great too), but if you need a Mac or can afford the splurge, absolutely get this Air M1."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,Nice laptop
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,Heard Mac was different but how is unreal nothing your use to doing is easy to find on this system. Be sure you can operate it I could not sent it back for normal laptop.
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"I like the shape, the weight,I dislike the material it is made of , and limited applications to install on it"
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"I bought ""used"" but MacBook Air looks NIB (new in box) New for $752.39. I very happy with purchase"
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"I previously used the Macbook Pro because I needed to create sales and marketing materials using Adobe apps,  PowerPoint and Final Cut Pro (video).  I now have a Macbook Air with the M1 processor (SOC = system on a chip) that  DESTROYS my 2020 Macbook Pro with an Intel chip.The Air machines don't even have a cooling fan which means it runs silently! It has handled everything I currently do without breaking a sweat and it even can run Parallels with Windows 10 on ARM better than a Surface Pro X.These M1-powered machines are incredible. Unless you have a specific need for an Intel-based machine or you have a very proprietary application that is not yet compatible with the M1, I strongly recommend you consider a unit such as this Macbook Air, the similar Macbook Pro or even the Mac Mini (all available with the M1)."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,I love this ease of transferring my data from my old Mac. It is a bit smaller though the screen is the same size so that’s nice. I’m not tech savvy so can’t say much about that aspect. My disappointment is that it doesn’t have a USB port like the old one for charging other devices on the side.
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"I owned a MacBook Pro in the past. This time around, there was no real selling point for the pro. So I got the 512gb air, so that I get better storage as well as the 8 core gpu. the base only comes with a 7 core. I love this laptop, for light to medium gaming, media browsing and for productivity. This laptop hits it out of the park. Stupid fast, great battery and a wonderful premium feel that no other laptop can match. This apple m1 processor is a beast and should scare the heck out of intel. This baby plays Minecraft and high settings with good frame rate, and pairs up amazingly with my other apple devices. Apple is really pushing hard to bring a great product here, at a competitive price. In the thin and light laptop market, apple destroys the windows laptops in every way."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,Easy to set up. Lightweight. Great keyboard. Couldn’t be happier.
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"This is a very solid device.  Wonderful job, Apple!  The only thing unexpected about it was the weight... the dimensions are smaller than the old macbook air my wife had, but heavier.  Screen size is the same (thinner bezzle around the edges).I am going to give it 5 stars because... come on!  Apple's own M1 processor!  But I will throw in a provisio.  Google's chrome (native for the M1 processor) seg-faults quite a bit on this unit, though it has slowly been getting better as Google has updated the application to work better with the M1.  I do expect google will fix these issues over the next few weeks, it is a very new system after all and a new architecture target for chrome.  But beware of that.I do wish Apple had kept the mag-safe power supply, but I'm not gonna dock Apple any stars for using USB-C for charging.-Matt"
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"Replaced a MacBook Pro from work when I got laid off.  I'm not really an Apple person, but know my way around.  I am looking for tech writer job so creativity apps are priority.  Still need remote windows machine for rare missing software.When connecting external Dell monitor, it couldn't detect (or support?) correct settings.  Cannot get image to fill full wide screen..  Worked flawlessly on MacBook Pro.I miss right hand usb ports.  Nice screen resolution.Rosetta stone wasn't pre-installed like review articles indicated.  Works well after painless install.Wifi connection not nearly as good as MacBook Pro.  My Routers (3 choices: Orbi, Synergy, Motorola) are all wonky; old machine stayed connected for weeks, this one hops between networks multiple times per day, each time cancelling current network jobs.Love the battery life, nice portability, looks good.  Fast wake and fast reliable fingerprint recognition."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"I bought this because I've historically had a good experience with the longevity of my last Macbook air. I dislike the OS, I hate the ""magic"" keyboard with the weird 10 key placement, I hate the ""magic"" trackpad and it's the biggest waste of money I've spent, and most of all, I hate ""Numbers"", both the software & also now the word itself. Apple should ""think differently"" and stop causing problems when I'm saving an Excel file, deleting an entire day's work, which I don't think I've experienced before so it was a weird & interesting feeling. If this thing doesn't retain it's longevity, I'll just eliminate Apple from my life forever. The business cycle seems to be nearing.Edit: Also for some reason, this thing just keeps restarting itself, the last few times I've used Excel. Did I get a lemon? I'm about to raise hell."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"It’s okay, not worth the price but it’s okay. Works as it should and it’s a nice computer. Wish there were more downloadable apps from the App Store. Huge swing and miss on apples part"
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"The camera is not really current. Especially for a laptop in this price range. It’s not much, if any, better than the toshiba laptop I got at Walmart for $400 back in like 2010. It is actually fine for me because I don’t rely on it for work or anything. But if you rely on it for virtual meetings, FaceTime, zoom, etc, you will be disappointed in the camera quality. I have very little need for the camera so it doesn’t bother me personally. But the camera is absolutely embarrassing for what has been named the laptop of the year by many, and I would agree, it’s a great computer. Great battery life, super fast charging, very light, not quiet—silent. Quiet implies there is a minimal amount of noise. There is no fan in this and it’s is literally silent. No noise at all, at any level that I can discern. Really fast. Best laptop I’ve ever had for sure."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,I like this deal
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,I liked
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"Se la compré a mi hermana y hasta me antojé yo de una. Yo soy estudiante de ingienería en software y pues todos los dias estamos en contacto con computadores y la mayoría de ellos Windows y distribuciones de Linux. Muchos de nosotros, como estudiantes de esta rama,  tenemos una mala imagen de lo que es Apple como marca: que básicamente te venden la manzana mordida, pero al fin y al cabo todo esto son prejuicios. Al final me di cuenta que estaba equivocado. Una cosa segura es que te puedas comprar una PC con mejores especificaciones a este precio, pero la belleza y lo fino que son estas MacBook y el sistema operativo, hace que, aunque suene raro, las especificaciones queden un poco de lado. En fin. Súmamente feliz de este producto, es algo diferente a lo habitual, y había experimentarlo para poder juzgar. 10/10"
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,The item was choice and invaluable! Very good-looking packaging. Speedy to send.
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"Looks brand new, fast, works great."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"Great condition, great product! More than happy"
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,For the price and it apple product. I expected much more. Not able to download certain apps due to the small storage space on the laptop. Have to purchase an extra adapter for additional  USB ports.
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,Love my new Mac!!’
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"This laptop served me extremely well for more than six years. It is depandable and fun. Storage was the only downside - as a photographer, I struggled with the 512 GB that was available at the time."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,The track pad for this machine is too smooth for me and gives my aging hands problems. And using the arrow keys to scroll doesn't work the same as my Chromebooks. I don't see where the Retina screen is in any way superior to my Toshiba HD Chromebooks.
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"Lightweight, blazing fast, easy to use, battery life is incredible with the new Apple M1 chip.  A typical Great Apple product.However, there is only a Thunderbolt port, so you now have to go out and buy a cable to convert USB to thunderbolt (if you want to use a backup hard drive) or other USB items, AND, I had to buy yet another cable to sync my phone's lightning port to the thunderbolt port on the computer. Total $56.I LOVE Apple product, and worked for them in my caerer, but I would wait on buying this version until the software for it has been developed.UPDATE: After several months of using this computer, I have have found several things of concern:1.  my notification center keeps disappearing, despite my constant reinstalling the widgets.2.  my computer's calendar, reminders, and photo stream do not sync with my IOS devices (iPhone & iPad).  If I add an item to calendar on my phone, it will appear on my mac but not vice versa.  Reminders will not sync regardless of which device I originate the item on.I have contacted Apple support on all these issues and they cannot solve the problem.IT APPEARS THAT THE BUGS HAVE NOT BEEN WORKED OUT, YET.  THINGS ARE MADDENINGLY CLUNKY!"
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,all forms of establishing this computer to the correct running system et/al went smoothly except all the  passwords were defined in a not described format and the email program could not be connected as iCloud had my email buried within the demographics it contained. it took two hours with apple to be able to send emails as the computer did not allow my google email to connect . However it is a very beautiful computer...wow...what a ride and an amazing thing to experience the apple representative and how he went thru each and every system...very interesting.
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"I've been using this computer for about 6 weeks now. Hopefully I don't jinx myself by posting this review, but so far I've not had any issues at all. The computer came in the original Apple packaging and was ready to use within minutes. There is a noticeable difference in the SSD performance which now comes standard instead of the older HDD. Load times are much faster and you don't get that clicking/whirring sound you'd get from an HDD. It's also incredibly light, so it's easy to take from room to room. Great battery life as well. I don't plan to run any heavy programs like Pro Tools or Final Cut on it, but for web browsing, spreadsheets, and streaming movies it has been excellent."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,My son uses it for college
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"So forget about all the other reviews. This is the skinny from a higher learning teacher: Is it fast? Yes. If you are browsing the web, watching videos, etc. It’s faster than my MSI with 16gb ram and RTX 2060 video card. Is it silent? YES. It’s the whole reason I bought it, so good for me. How is rendering audio or video? Good, BUT…My iMac 5k from 2017 with 4gb of video ram is faster with the few renderings I have done. The following is what surprised me (especially after reading all the fab reviews of battery): I put my Mac Air on sleep mode when I shut it down. Didn’t use it for a couple days, came back to get it and the battery was completely dead. Zero! I was VERY surprised.  I can always leave an MSI, Lenovo, HP, on sleep mode for a week or more. Those are the things I have experienced in my first week. Hope it helps."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"Super smooth performance, quiet fanless operation.Great deal!"
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,I have had this computer for a while now and it has yet to let me down. I love it.I would recommend this as a college student.
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"Amo todo lo que sea Apple y sinceramente no me decepcionó, súper slim, rápida, es como traer tu iphone en mano! Simplemente la amo!"
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"It's a mac. That's literally the only reason I bought it to customize an app that was iOS compatible only. Outside of that, the Camera is horrendous (its giving very 2011 photobooth camera quality) and if you have too many browsers or apps opens it practically crashes. Not really worth the prices in my opinion. Just pay the premium for a macbook pro if the camera and performance is a make or break for you."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,Excellent value.
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"I appreciate that the price was discounted for a great value.  The package was secure and well-packaged, which was very important, given that this was delivered via mail.  No cracks on the screen.  The processing speed is quick, which is extremely helpful!  I appreciate there were instructions, in a small pamphlet, that explained how to transfer everything from your previous MacBook to this MacBook.  A seamless transition is vital and means less frustration.  This MacBook Air is very user friendly, especially visually.  As someone who wears glasses, I appreciate the option to make the pointer larger, the ability to have more contrast, etc...  That the user manual automatically pops up and walks you through enhancements and new features makes this even more user-friendly."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"This Macbook is definitely great for users who want lots of power and versatility, but don't want to break the bank. It is very lightweight and sleek.The color (gold) is also very pretty, but keep in mind that it is more of a pinkish gold than a yellow gold. However, the camera quality is not great for such an otherwise powerful laptop. Especially in this era of zooming and FaceTiming, a good camera is essential in a laptop. It's not terrible, but its not great either. Another thing - the front lid of the MacBook got a couple of scratches very easily. I was able to get them off, but I would suggest getting a good quality case to ensure that this doesn't happen. All in all I would rate this Macbook a 4.5/5! Definitely lived up to the hype!"
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,Rápida y comoda
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,Edit: didn’t return- it did offgass - needed to be cleaned withe alcohol based cleaner. multiple times and left out & open for 2 weeks before chem smells were gone.Just dont expect to be able to use it right out of box if you have MCS/TILTOriginal: Smells so badly I have to return it.
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,I needed to replace my 2015 MacBook Air since it was getting slow and I’m running low on storage.  It was an improvement but is not perfect.  Price wise it is an excellent buy and a lot cheaper than other Apple offerings.  I was pleasantly surprised how easy it is to transfer data and applications using time machine with Apple migration assistant.  The display is outstanding. What I don’t like is the lack of ports and no MagSafe connection for power.  And I prefer Catalina over Big Sur but maybe I’ll get used to it.  Also if you plan on keeping it for more than a couple of years and take a lot of pictures or movies 256 GB is not enough memory.  Get at least 512.
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,I had previously purchased a “renewed” MacBook Air and it wasn’t exactly what I would call renewed. I returned it and found a new MacBook Air for under $900. Only a few hundred more than someone else’s old one and I couldn’t be happier. I’ve had iPhones since 3GS and they have always been user friendly and the MacBook Air is just like my iPhone but better.I have always had windows and the last one installed the manufacturer update and afterwards I could not log into the computer. That’s the end of windows and the beginning of my Mac attack.I highly recommend this item especially if you are able to purchase it for under $900.
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"Not much to say, excellent product overall. No cons except lack of ports. All day+ battery life, excellent screen. Keyboard is good as well. I have the 8 gb ram version but haven't seen any lag due to it. Use it often to run demanding simulations and it has not disappointed me so far.I was little concerned with the M1 chip and compatibility. However, x86-64 runs well enough, though CPU/ram usage is a bit higher (dropbox, for example). If you are using native versions, its far better than any x86-64 mobile cpus on market."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"Light, fast, and intuitive...happy with the product (disclosure: I'm an Apple fan)"
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"I just opened the outer box containing a Mac Air M1.  If you look at the picture, it will tell you why the Apple Store gets a 2 and I feel that is appropriate.  There is NO protection on one side and none on top or bottom.  When it was picked up off the porch, it bounced inside and you can figure that the USPS was not as careful as it was by any stretch of the imagination.  This is not a $10 item, it’s a highly rated Laptop.  Seriously folks???"
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"I purchased the MacBook Air to replace a 4th Gen Surface Pro that was down to about 30 minutes of battery life.  I purchased an Intel Mac Mini about six months ago and was intrigued by recent news articles regarding the M1 chip.  I'm thrilled with the added battery life on the new device and amazed by the speed difference between my Intel-based mini vs. the M1.  Out of the box, adding a full charge, the new Mac estimates 19+ hours of battery life.  I've been using the computer for three hours, four open apps, and have bumped the battery gauge to 98%.  Think I've eliminated battery anxiety.  App launches are two to three times faster on the Air vs. my Mini.  The new laptop is zippy!  I'm thrilled with my new laptop and look forward to many years together."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"If I could go back I probably would though past the time now.I'd say I'm computer savvy, spent years of time on windows programs, photoshop etc. Now that my current Dell Inspiron is reaching the end of its life, I followed all the great reviews and purchased this MacBook Air M1.Everything is hard. I actually loved my Dell in many ways, though hopefully its life, around 4-5 years, is about half what this Mac will be.Things I'm missing the most so far, a touch screen, the ability to fully open ie fold-back and flatten the rotation the screen, even the fact of needing to use 3 fingers to take screen-shots instead of an allocated button, the delete button is actually a back-space not delete button. Notifications keep coming in upper right corner, blocking what I might want to access there. One needs to go through each app to change the setting btw, there's no default to say do not show notifications. It would at least be good to have the option to change the location of where they show up. I much prefer chrome to safari, though found on reading that chrome eats up a lot more power. I downloaded Flotata this morning which is supposed to help though I haven't tried yet. Incredibly frustrating especially when time is very limited, trying to figure things out!! Have spent hours on calls with Apple support which thankfully is very accessible. But my computer seems glitchy, sometimes the screen-sharing doesn't work. I haven't purchased a mouse as yet for it and also finding ""right-clicking"" with 2 finger tapping to be frustrating and not working as I'd expect it to.Overall unfortunately not a happy camper. Maybe for Mac users it may be a good machine for whatever reason.I was also very torn whether to get the 8 or 16gb, I went with the 8. I don't think that would make a difference at this early stage of being new.I also tried to have my teen daughter, who's used to Macs, give me tips though she was't terribly helpful so I watched a couple of YouTube vids which gave some guidance, things are not intuitive.I don't like posting negative reviews, though sharing this in case others in similar situations ie needing to carry on with trying to get things done, while their windows laptop is reaching the end of its life and needing to choose a new machine, may find this helpful.Also as an fyi, I had to pay an additional nearly $300 to have my 2 external hard-drives transferred onto a new Mac compatible one, so I can access all my previous work.Wishing everyone better luck!"
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"Everything about this machine has been fantastic.  I could not afford new, but I have found this only a hairsbreadth less than spanking new.  Best for me, since I was away from the wonderful Apple side for several years, Apple help is as fine as the machine.  Plan to go this route next time."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"This laptop is really fast and the battery lasts really long.The battery lasts me about a week with just one charge and I find that crazy.There is not fan noise and this doesn't get hot.The quality is really good.. I mean the way the laptop opens with one hand and the smooth closing of the lid is really smooth.The screen isn't the best but its still really good.This laptop has the M1 chip, fastest chip on the market.This laptop's bench marks are off the roof.It's great for casual use like, watching movies, using word docs and excel sheet, coding and video editing.I wouldn't recommend gaming even though basic games will do just fine."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"Nothing wrong with the system, but it took more than 2 weeks to arrive, and in the process, the M2 dropped in price. So I'll return this and get the M2.  A waste of my time when I could have used it most.  The wait was really disappointing."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,Great product
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,Overpriced and very thin be careful
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,The computer is everything I thought it would be. Gave the camera a 3 star because quality could be better but I don’t use FaceTime as much so it’s not a big deal to me. Overall so worth the money. Great investment for my book writing and finances.Definitely a major upgrade from my HP.Now I wasn’t sure who to contact about delivery or where to write it but I don’t appreciate having told them I want someone to sign for it being it is a high value priced item and it was just thrown on my porch and I wasn’t notified at all then when I go look it says it was directly handed to me. Don’t like liars so Amazon you need to get it together because if this would have gotten stolen I would have raised hell for my money back.-thanks.
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"I assumed the computer was new, I’m not sure that I did not get a renewed one. The computer seems fine so far, but the charger was defective, and I had to spend 30.00 on a new aftermarket charger. You would think the product would be tested. Not a great experience."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,Looks and feels fantastic
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"They sent the wrong color, but it's otherwise great"
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"I hate laptops, until I bought this one anyway. I probably burned through over a dozen  or so over the past decade. One of them was actually another Mac Air. I wasn’t impressed. This 2020 model however provides all the power and versatility that I’ve only previously dreamed about.  The Retina display is gorgeous, clear and easy to read. This PC runs Photoshop faster and cleaner than desktops that cost me $3000 or more. Music played back on this little laptop sounds better than any other I’ve heard.  The new Apple M1 chip really shines, beating the Intel versions of this laptop hands down."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"I was hesitant buying a MacBook, I said I'd never do it. But after having my iPhone for so long I and my most recent laptop dying, I figured I could take the chance. I love it, it is basically just an iPhone in laptop form. I will miss Microsoft Office Suite, but I don't really need it for that so it is ok."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"I left the Apple product line years ago due to their practice of ""forced obsolesce"" with early iPhone models. Having worked in IT for most of my career I like being able to have full control of my device. Apple mostly locks up their devices.But, I decided to give the MacBook Air 2020 a chance because: 1. my MS Surface didn't last long enough for the money and it, too, is hardware locked and 2. I was impressed with the M1 specification.After playing with this machine I have to say the M1 is AWESOME! The screen response is shockingly quick in comparison to other PCs and Apple devices.I highly recommend ONLY buying an Apple device WITH a M1 processor."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,Holy cow this is the best product I have ever owned no malicious baloney fast easy to use and very enjoyable recommends product I really do
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,My daughter loves this laptop. She will be taking this same laptop to college. I didn’t like the price but if she’s able to keep this laptop and finish college with it. That will justify the outrageous price.
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"But, I love this laptop.  After asking multiple people who have purchased the same (or better) models and I couldn't be happier purchasing even the lowest end model of MacBook Air.  Does everything I would expect an Apple Computer to do (for what I need it for, basic photo editing, viewing, and typing). So far it's been an amazing purchase.  Just for the sake of keeping Apple on their toes I rated the Battery Life 4 stars and the camera quality 4 stars, as well as the 4 star overall review.  Keep it up Apple, as long as you continue to make the products user-friendly I'll remain a happy customer for years to come."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,I ordered gold and received silver. Disappointed and never got contacted by the seller about it but everything else is perfect
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"I had a 2008 MacBook Pro that I used until 2014. I then switched back to a PC until purchasing this M1 MacBook a month ago. I don’t know why I haven’t been using a Mac sooner. Having messages and FaceTime and synced with my phone, along with MS office functionality makes this computer a dream to use.Only issue I had was using a usb c to display port plug to plug into my monitor. Worked great until the latest update of Big Sur. Have an open case with Apple and they seem perplexed, but a quick review of reddit shows this seems to be an issue with the M1 chip. I ended up purchasing a usb-c to hdmi adapter and have had no further issues, except being out $15 for the first cable."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"I switched from a PS to a MacBook Air never dreaming Mac would be sooooooo difficult to operate. Stupid things like images not downloading in some emails, setting up folders, how to download a file to that folder, all are completed, and Apple support is totally for geeks not the average user.If I could afford it, I would burn this computer and buy another PC for all the STRESS the MacBook Air has caused me."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"Good for what it's worth.I'm not a fan of the price, but guess it's just another Apple thing.Great laptop for daily use.The key keyboard is great. I'm not a professional on computers so I'll usually have to look at the keyboard while I type, but not on this one the keys are positioned perfectly.Nice and crisp resolution.Pretty fast.All around great daily use laptop."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,Es más pequeña
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,This is a great laptop that is thin and durable. I would recommend a skin or case due to how lightweight it is!
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"I love my new MacBook. It convenient, advanced technology, light weight and all of my apple devices are connected!"
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,Love this Mac.  Arrived fast and packaged well.  Works great and as a first time Mac user it was very easy to learn.  Great price at Amazon and very happy with the purchase.  The computer is very fast.
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,Si tienes o logras una tarjeta de Amazon puedes pagar mensualmente una  mínima cantidad  y compras una macbook que aunque no es de pantalla táctil es de excelente calidad.
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,The MacBook arrived in new condition. and works wonderfully. I was also able to update to the most recent version of Mac OS. Great value Hundreds off a similar new machine.
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,I’m an APPLE user and not surprised with the functionality and quality
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"The media could not be loaded.
                



 Bought this laptop bc i needed it for spring semester and i needed an upgrade from my heavy macbook pro. I go to work too so i needed something super light and thin i can just bring everywhere and slide it in my bag.I am obsessed with how fast this macbook is. The battery life is on point. I used it for movies and series at work and it lasted for 3 days. The processor is definitely sooo good. I open so many tabs at once and it has not lagged on me. The keyboard and trackpad is responsive.I love the color. The main reason why i bought this too. 😍😂I have no problems with it at all.Highly recommend"
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"I love this MacBook! The battery life is amazing and I have been able to complete work tasks easily. I love the size because I can carry the MacBook when I travel without having to use a big laptop bag. The screen quality is great, but I had a little difficulty seeing the screen outside in a sunny area. Although, when I found some shade I had no problems at all. I am not outside much in the sun on the MacBook so this isn’t a big deal for me. Overall, great product in my opinion. It is perfect for what I need to do for work."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,Just about the only thing I have objections to is that I don't really like the touchpad much. It doesn't always behave intuitively and I've had to tweak settings to get it to where I'm fairly comfortable using it.But generally... Solid laptop. Good buy.
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"This laptop actually lives up to all the hype about the M1 chip and such. It is lightning fast, smooth, clear easy to read screen  and the battery lasts and lasts for all day and then some. Also I have noticed that with any normal use it doesn't even get warm so the lack of a fan is not a detriment but nice as a nonexistent fan can't make any noise. I was slightly skeptical but as a multiple APPLE owner not surprised I was happy. Seriously I just sent a 3 year old iPad that had been used hard daily for a battery replacement and received a brand new iPad 3 days after I sent it in. Thats service as well."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"This laptop is perfect for student for collage. It is extremely fast however the restarting of this laptop isn’t that fast which is kind strange. Overall I find no faults with this device, I have the 8gb ram version and it performs like a champ for all my needs as a student. I totally recommend this device."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"I'm not really a mac user, but I heard a lot of good stuffs on YouTube about M1 Macbook air and want to give it a try. Guess what. I don't think any Windows laptop around this price range can beat this M1 Macbook air. No fan, so it is quiet yet there is almost no heat. Battery life is insanely good. If you are looking for everyday laptop around 900-1000 bucks, this is it. Highly recommended. However, if you play games alot (especially Windows games), then this is a no go."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"Likes:- Great performance despite seemingly underpowered on paper.- Battery life is outstandingDislikes:- There were repeated Safari crashes for first few weeks (since cleared up)- MagSafe plug is gone, though it's nice to have standard USB-C power.- Expensive storage upgrades- A lot of software is still unoptimized for new M1 hardware, but performance is generally acceptable even so- CapsLock delay continues to annoy the hell out of meOther:- Keyboard is fine (upgrading from a 2014 MacBook Pro keyboard, which was solid)- Good for lightweight software development"
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,Its a rlly good laptop tbh. The only downfall is that it's not touch screen and isn't rlly good for gaming. Other than that it's amazing!
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,it arrived very well and quickly
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"I used HP laptops for years, their average screen size is like 17, up to almost 20 inch screen size. For this 13 inch MacBook, at first I was surprised, but the second I set things up I got real excited. Siri is super helpful, Mac is small, very easy to carry, super convenient. One thing I like the most is the Touch ID to open laptop. After using Mac I've decided to purchase the latest iPad, Apple products actually worth the money!"
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,Really good
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"I absolutely love this laptop. I'm a software engineer and as you can imagine I spend a lot of time of the computer. This computer is lightning fast, a dream to type on, and it has a beautiful screen. The only downside is that camera quality, which is absolutely atrocious. I have a desktop PC that I do my web conferencing over anyways, so it's not big deal for me. If you really care about the webcam, I would suggest purchasing a third-party webcam. Other than that, I highly recommend this product and I could not be more pleased with it."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"I’ve had my MacBook for about a month now, it’s been amazing. I take it to school everyday and each task I do on my Mac is so seem less. Overall amazing laptop with great battery life and an awesome screen. Definitely recommend for students, keyboard is also nice. Laptop is insanely light weight as well."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,I got this device to last me another 10 years. Will need to have purchased a connector for separate storage devices for standard USB connectors and camera disks. Like the size and portability. Keyboard and touch pad are fine as this was a concern prior to purchase.
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"I love this laptop. It's fast, practical, sleek, portable, and very useful for me as a college student who does remote work. I have never had a problem with it and I have been using it for a few months now. 100/10."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"So far we have had no problems with it. We bought it for my daughter for college. If there are any hiccups come fall, I can resubmit."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,It is exactly everything I wanted and I am so happy with my purchase!! I will definitely order again from this company!!
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"If you need a basic Mac and don't need lots of RAM or processing power, the Mac Air is perfect.  It's fast enough for internet connections, zoom calls, word or spreadsheet, Wordpress, etc.  Get 512GB drive, cuz modern software, photos, etc need more space."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,Had an intel based MacBook Pro that supported 2 additional displays natively. This one only supports one. Luckily has a display link hub as a workaround fo 2 additional monitors. Had no issues with M1 silicon
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"Great battery charge length – I haven't tested it such that I could report numbers, but clearly much much better than my previous 2018 Powerbook.Screen very good.The M1 processor is fast, but as expected didn't work on a few peripheral (for me) software types. However, these include iDVD and Microsoft messenger. But then again there may be upgrades available that I feel no compelling reason to pursue."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"I absolutely love this laptop. it gets the job done for what I need it for for work. I ran into one issue where I shut it down to charge for some time and then when I tried to restart it it was just a black screen with the arrow on the screen and I had to do a hard restart on it. it has only done that once since I got this but so far I do love it. I have and apple iPhone, iPad, and an Apple Watch and it was very easy to get all systems on the same page."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"My son who is studying in Florida called me to tell that his MacBook (7 years old) has some small issues and he is worried it could fail during an important session exam/test which is mostly done online under corona. So we had to buy quickly a new MacBook but where not sure whether the M1 would do it without issues regarding standard programs you use on the daily university live (like Office366, Team viewer, GoodNotes, etc.) Now after 3 week my son tells that there are no issues what’s so ever and he likes the performance and as well as the Batterie runtime. The price and shipping time was good as well!"
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,Like any laptop this laptop has its little quirks but overall this is one of the best laptops to purchase. I don't know if this is touchscreen but its not that big of a deal for a person like me . The picture/ video quality is great to look at and is very clear but the Photo Booth camera kinda sucks which is a little disappointing . Other than these little things the laptop is  pretty fast and  has all the essential app to create .
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"Pros. I Love the new M1 processor, I had an i5 MacBook air before this one that was fast, this one is to me compares to the i9 for speed.Cons, I don't like that you have to buy an adapter to have a USB or to use my camera SD card, plus they took away the magnetic cord you charge with now it is just a plug-in like the Macbook Pro. Being a Computer tech I see problems in the future with it being a plug, they always seem to loosen up as the years go on. Other than that I LOVE IT!"
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"I love this MacBook. It’s the first I’ve ever owned and I don’t  regret it. The only problem with it, like many other Apple products, is compatibility, of course. Other than that, I love it!"
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"I am overall very satisfied with my 2020 Apple MacBook Air purchase. Every works smooth and no problems so far. Powerful laptop. For now, I highly recommend."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,It’s a good laptop with all around features and heavy build quality. Missing some of the pro features but otherwise it works great
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"Nice product, as usual for Apple!"
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,Best laptop ever I had
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,As much as I enjoy my new MacBook. It is way too soon to be experiencing loading delays. I barely have anything loaded on the computer and I have experienced several delays.
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"I just love this Macbook air.  It replaced my 2014 model that was an 11 inch model.  IT is like light years ahead of that computer, although the old one is wonderful too.  The keyboard is smooth as silk and so easy to type on. I could go on and on about the screen.  Crisp, clear, bright, and wonderful.  I really enjoy the backgrounds on Big Sur as well now.  The speed with the M1 chip is phenomenal on all the programs that I use.Youtube is a great place to get more technical reviews than I have left.  But from an ordinary, person this laptop is fabulous."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,I had a great experience.  I love my new computer!
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"The MacBook Air is an amazing machine! I absolutely love it!!! I only wish that it had more ports on it. Not a huge deal because I bought a hub for more ports, but would have been nice to see more ports on this thing. Other than that, I love how responsive it is, and I love the picture quality! Also, the battery life on this thing is unreal!!! I have left it off the charger for well over a week and have not needed to charge it. It is amazing!!!"
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"Works as expected. Shipping was quick. The rose-gold color is a very pretty shade. I have had Macs in the past, but not an Air. I love how thin it is. Not many ports and only two USB-C ones, so note that. I mainly needed just my iPhone 12 Pro to be able to plug into it, so it works for me.My last Mac was a 2011 MacBook Pro. It still works great, but I needed some updated stuff. Just the fact that it lasted me 10+ years shows its value. It is worth it. Once you go Mac, you never go back. ;)"
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"Like the updated M1 processor.  Like the extra memory.  Don't like the ""Left outs"".  No lighted apple logo on the cover.  It was replaced by a mirror like decal. (Cheap)  Don't like the lack of ports.  No HCMI, no SDHC memory slot for you camera memory chip, you need to buy adaptor for USBC and there are only 2 on the left none on the right only a 3.5 mm audio jack. In addition when charging the unit there is no indication, no light no sound, nothing that lets you know it is charging.Cheap, cheap cheap....shame on you Apple."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"In general I love this MacBook Air. I have had other Apple products but this is my first laptop.  It has a great display, it opens easily with touch (fingerprint) ID, you can move easily from here to there and not lose any information. It is great for most purposes. The things I have had trouble with are the Apple word processing, spreadsheet or presentation programs, so I continue to use Office 365. That is not totally fair in this review as the device is wonderful!"
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,Recommended
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"muy buen producto y calidad. excelente pantalla, funciona perfecto el lector táctil, rápida al abrir pantalla entre muchas otras cualidades. RECOMENDACIONES: comprar un buen protector de la computadora, comprarle un multi conector de 12 en 1 y que trabaje por los 2 puertos USB-C para distribuir la carga y flujo de trabajo. Adicionalmente si su cartera aguanta comprar la version de 16gb de ram, hice pruebas de carga navegación, abrir y cerrar videos de instagram como 6 veces seguidas y me aparecía en pantalla que la carga de la pagina navegada consumía muchos recursos."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,lo esperado
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"I have buyers regret now.  I bought this to update from my old Mac Pro and was hoping I could get some streaming apps like Netflix, Hulu, etc and none of that is available.  I use my laptop for movies and TV while traveling.  No CD drive and none of the aforementioned items make this laptop basically useless to me"
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,Wish build in a word processor.
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"Overall it works fine except it must be plugged in all the time. battery is garbage, not really refurbished, just resold. I will have to pay $ to put in a new battery at the Apple store. Ugh."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"I love my MacBook Air! I chose gold, it’s such a beautiful classy color. It came in original packaging packed very safely. I haven’t tried the camera yet.I switched to iPads since 2010 and haven’t missed crashing windows one bit. I needed to do a few things my iPad wouldn’t do a Mac it was! The battery life is amazing, and the screen brightness is great, I’ve heard it isn’t bright as the MacBook Pro but I can’t believe anything would be brighter! I can’t put the brightness but half way up."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"There’s nothing I don’t like and I’m sure I have not explored everything in my new Air. pro, the screen quality is great, I do not have touch screen and I do not play games on the Computer only on my IPhone.To make along story short, it’s great."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"Excellent battery, speedy, lightweight. You do not often come across these three benefits together. This is still a great purchase if you (like me) do the regular zoom meetings, graphic design, edit 4k video, some spreadsheet work and occasionally edit batches of 100 photos in raw format in Lightroom. Go spend some more in a M1 Pro or Max if you really need that much computational power for 3d or heavy 8k video editing."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,I needed a new computer and this one is just right for me. Very easy to set up and user friendly. I don't know a lot about computers but my sons said I made a good choice with this one. The rose gold is a fun color and a change from drab gray or silver.
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"This is my first Apple computer and I love it.  Just be aware that this MacBook Air doesn't natively support two external monitors.  All you need to do however, is buy theHyperDrive Dual 4K HDMI 10-in-1 USB-C Hub directly from Hyperdrive to resolve this issue."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"No option to buy a macbook air at a bigger size, this screen feels a bit small, no 120hz and, no touchscreen really makes it feel dated. Great battery life, the metal finish is really slippery, I bought a d-brand skin to fix that. Good little laptop for general use, web browsing, lite gaming.The screen, even for a 60hz panel has some ghosting that may bother some."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,My feet.
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"This is my 4th Mac laptop, the earlier ones were all MacBook Pros.  I was reticent about getting an Air, but with the M1 chip, this thing is a superb replacement.  So small & light, yet speedy.  Only drawback is the fixed 8GB RAM complement.  I take care not to send the thing into swap- suspending old browser tabs is essential."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"This is a M1 Macbook Air what more can we say?  We went with Used - Good Condition Space Gray in order to save money and so far everything looks and works well.  There were 2 battery cycles, minor signs of use on the bottom, and the charger was obviously used but otherwise its in good shape.  There were about 8 months of factory warranty left and I couldn't add applecare+ since it was bought used so I went with a 3rd party warranbty service instead."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"Best laptop you can buy but mine came scratched idk why Apple is trying to punish me for but it's fine. Also be really careful because the screen is special, it has a coating for retina display and even touching it or gently cleaning it can remove some of the coating and leave subtle blue marks. Sound is boxy I'd recommend SpeakerAmp and choose flat sound to get a clearer sound. But nothing is perfect of course and for that price this is a great investment"
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,I got this for school after my hp computer's battery stopped working. It's really great for the price! the screen resolution is really nice and the touch id is a good add on. I really wish apple would make touch screen macbooks but they probably never will. it also doesn't have a usb port which is kind of weird. learning the controls takes some time but overall a great computer!
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"Smaller form than the Macbook Air it replaced but screen size was the same. Lighter, too! The rose gold is beautiful and the computer works incredibly well and is lightning fast. Migration assistant made data transfer from old to new a piece of cake. Absolutely love it!"
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,I love my new Apple MacBook Air. It’s has a new operating system that I am getting used to. The machine itself is wonderful it reminds me of my G4 and PRO Power Tower the great grandfather and parent of my new MacBook Air. As soon as I get PS I will be dancing with my new toy and being creative again. My MacBook Air arrived in great condition and ready to go. I have been an Apple girl for many years and love their products. Thank you so much.
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,Nothing comes close. Best value for top class product. its an APPLE. closest to this is a Surface but the OS in this thing is much safer and built with more security in mind.
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"Can't add much that hasn't already been said. I upgraded from a 2017 MacBook Air and find this to be superior in just about every way. The battery life is at least twice what the 2017 was, the screen is much better, the keyboard is better, the overall size of the computer is smaller and I love the larger haptic feedback touchpad. I don't use the camera but it isn't the greatest from what I understand and I do kind of miss the magsafe connector."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"I gave this purchase a run around and delayed purchasing it for a good while, but I cant stress enough how amazing this computer has been. I take it around with me for studying and playing music and just basic stuff but is amazing, the m1 chip is quite a game changer."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,I had a MacBook Pro 13 2015...that machine lasted a long time and I love it. It dropped and I needed a replacement fast. MacBook Air 2020 is not a disappointment. The battery life even if downloading is incredible. I had it downloading all night and I still have a charge. It was only a slow download because the internet speed sucks. The touch ID is a delight. I love the picture quality. So far I am so impressed. Hopefully it will last as much as the other lasted.
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"Recibi el articulo con la misma calidad que el de una tienda. Sin problemas hasta el momento. Inicialmente pensé que el equipo tendría 8 GPU sin embargo he recibido la versión de 7 GPU aunque para mí esta bien hubiese querido 8, creo que parte de la descripción del producto eran 8 GPU.En cuanto a la temperatura un poco preocupado porque en ciertos momentos del día presenta un indice alto para mi, sin embargo consultando con Apple vía soporte me han comentado que se encuentra dentro de los rangos."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"Such a nice laptop. I am upgrading from a 2012 MacBook and this one is light years ahead of the game compared to that one. It’s slim, fast, user friendly, and the iconic apple products that I’ve grown to love."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,The only issue I have is when watching Apple TV. The sound quality Isaac under heavy bass
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"I'm giving this a 5 star because the laptop is perfect for what it is and the seller was great, however I watched multiple YouTube videos glorifying the M1 chip as being fast enough that 8GB could handle a ton of open applications. I need a bunch of tabs open for my work, use Canva constantly, and occasionally need to open Photoshop too so I needed to return this and buy 16GB. But that's my fault and the YouTube reviews faults, not the laptop. Battery life is amaaaazing though!"
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"No dislikes with this product.  Likes, it is easy to use and navigate which i loved from the start."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,It's a good laptop. It's an Apple so it is overpriced but you have to expect that buying any Apple product
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"I've always been a windows PC user. The brand I normally get doesn't sell anymore. I decided to switch to Mac. Oh my...I wish I'd done it sooner. I love this computer so much. It's fast. The screen quality is amazing. I had to get used to it not being a touch screen but it's worth losing that feature. I don't miss windows at all. Everything is so much easier to use. If you're hesitating, don't. You won't regret it."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"Yo compré esta computadora porque mi antigua laptop tenía seis años y me estaba causando muchas dificultades en mi trabajo y con mis clases. Entran en zoom era un problema y con está computadora no me ha pasado. Es la primera vez que tengo una Mac y aunque al principio me costó un poco acostumbrarme al sistema de apple, pero la rapidez y duración de la bateria valen la pena. Es muy fácil trabajar con esta computadora, mientras que con la otra podía esperar hasta una hora para que terminara de cargar un programa. La recomiendo."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"The outward look of this Mac Air is not that different from my MacBook Pro that I bought in 2015 - with one exception: the new model has the M1 Chip and it never seams to heat up. The old model sizzled enough to brand your legs if you use it in laptop position.No complaints on Apple products, though. I can only hope this M1 model lasts as long. It’s a good bet because heat is one of the chief reasons for internal parts going bad. This is one cool computer!"
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,This is my second time purchasing an Apple Computer. They last a really long time. I got this one for my business.
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"No issues with this MacBook, came in perfect condition, very easy to navigate, LOVE the Touch ID, and the camera quality is okay, not as good as a phone. The battery lasts about an entire day, and the charger that comes with it is super high quality. Buttons are very big and easy to see and push, the lighting on them is perfect. The touch pad being bigger is wonderful! Very light and easy to handle, get as much storage as you can afford. Able to do everything I need & more, 100% recommend."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,so nice
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"First time with a MacBook and it feels awesome. Nice OS, overall good look, sound and display have very good quality, battery life outstanding. The camera is mediocre though. I have always worked with windows and Linux and I’m getting used to this OS and I’m starting to love it. Similar feel when I was changing from Android to iPhone. I downloaded and installed Office 365 in a few minutes, for programming Python and Sublime Text work just fine. Safari works so fast! No complain after a week with this laptop"
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,Decided to switch from Windows and PC laptops to Apple MacBook and never turning back. Quality hardware and software and looking forward to many years of happy use. I can recommend this product.
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"Just have to say I'm really thrilled with the new M1 MacBook Air - worked all day (8+ hours) on a rather complex Excel workbook and the laptop never got warm and the battery is still at 43%! Can't say enough good things about this computer. The cost was within budget and the performance, well it's better than my iMac in many ways! Really glad I didn't wait for the next model to start enjoying Apple's new computer on a chip design. Thanks Apple!"
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"This was everything I expected it to be. The screen is small but bright. I use it for virtual teaching, it handles zoom, google meets and all my other needs. I can use my iPad as a second screen when needed. I like how my Apple ID paired this with all my devices. I charge it daily and it gets me though my daily needs. The only thing I didn’t get was a notification to purchase AppleCare. It’s easy enough to do online."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,This computer is awesome and full of plenty of power to do the most complex computing.It does not have a touch screen. I love mine!
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"This is my very first MacBook! I’ve been wanting to have one but couldn’t afford it. I was using my Sony laptop since 2004 and it finally broke. I thought, if I was gonna buy a new laptop it should be MacBook so I did save some money for it, but my savings could only afford MacBook Air 2020. I love it! It’s looks cool and I enjoy using it and will probably use until it lasts lol."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,I like the addition of the biometric authentication.  The set up was easy.  The transfer from old Mac to new Mac was a few hours but we are talking about a huge amount of data.  Everything transferred with no problems.
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"I’ve owned Mac’s for over 25 years and this is the worst I’ve ever owned. First off, the mouse buttons are a new horrible design that often do not recognize mouse clicks. Clicking this mouse is the worst experience I’ve ever had on any computer before. My previous 2018 Mac was much better in so many ways.Also i hate that this new Mac only has 2 ports both being USB-c. One is used to charge which means you only have a single USB-c port for use. Another huge downgrade.Also this Mac has the fancy new fingerprint scanner unlock and yet it forces me to re-enter my password constantly. So what is the point of a fingerprint scanner if i still need to re-enter my password 80% of the time?The keyboard also feels cheap and is very uncomfortable to use, another downgrade from my 2018 Mac. Literally this thing feels like a massive downgrade in nearly every way."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"The MacBook Air is as advertised. Fast and easy to use with a long battery life. Too few ports for my taste, and the keyboard is only OK. I use a Logitech mouse via Bluetooth, and it is responsive. One positive surprise is that the speakers in the laptop are better than those I've used in bigger machines."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"I am really pleased with this upgrade. My last one is a 2015 MacBook Air. It still works, but I wanted a more up to date one. The price was good and I love it."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,So far I’m super happy. I’ve always bought cheap laptops but felt it was time to invest in something better. I’ve never owned a Mac and fell in love immediately. It’s so nice to have my phone and watch work in sync with my computer. I didn’t realize what I was missing. It’s fancy and pretty and while I worry I might break it because it’s so thin and was pretty pricey I just can’t regret the purchase. I love it.
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"We own a MacBook Pro but needed a second laptop to keep the marriage from going off the tracks.  Bought the MacBook Air and are very pleased.  It's lighter than our pro, has similar performance, is a bit lighter and cheaper.  The only negative is that its two USBC ports are on one side, makes it trickier to keep it plugged in our seating situation.  Probably not an issue for most.  Oh, the battery life seems better than the Pro.  Definitely recommend it."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,so my thoughts are on the M1 air version and I must say its a great machine for the price it's my first apple device as I'm a pc gamer but I had to have this because of the ARM chipset being that it surpasses a lot of x86 chipsets it's very impressive the battery life is by far the most impressive thing about it...nothing at the moment beats the battery life it's great it has a great IPS display as well looks very vivid and sharp
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,The product is a 5/5 but Amazon and Chase get 0/5. I purchased this item over the holidays and got a great deal by selecting the 18 month interest-free payment plan. However there was NOTHING indicating that I needed to change my automatic payment settings in order for this plan to actually work (except for an email I received the day AFTER the full amount was charged). I first called Chase who told me they could refund the amount - but that they could not reinstate the payment plan promo that Amazon offered and I would be charged interest until the balance was paid off. Then I called Amazon who said there was nothing they could do and I needed to call Chase. I am beyond furious and severely disappointed with Amazon for not making this apparently necessary step more clear from the very beginning. I purchased this laptop to start my own business and now I am going into it with an overdrawn account. I hope my review  helps someone else avoid this mess.
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"This was my first MAC purchase! the QUALITY, ENGINEERING, CRAFTMANSHIP is TOP notch! Surprisingly NOT HARD to adapt to using coming from a PC! VERY happy.. absolutely LOVE all the VERY helpful features, still discovering NEW ones & FASTER ways to do things on it EVERYDAY. Plus it LOOKS like a million bucks & very nice/addictive feel to the the touch.. can't say ENOUGH GOOD things about MacBook Air.. APPLE - - you've hit a GRAND SLAM with this one & the M1 chip!! thanks."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"I was looking for a laptop that was easy to use, light and portable since I live in a apartment with wife and 2 kids there is no space to have a full blown desk so I needed something small and fast and this new MacBook Air is perfect, I love everything about it,  battery life is great but then again I mostly use it for light web browsing and email checking nothing heavy"
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"Love apple, but wish it was easier to adapt and find thing after using windows for so long. I have to search in safari for answers. Once, I figure out everything I will be much happier because it is so much faster."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,Great price and great computer!!
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"Ive had this computer for 2 months now, and I still can’t find a single thing to complain about. The battery will last me 12 hours of gaming, something I didn’t think was even possible out of a high-performance laptop. When I say high performance, I mean it. This thing runs Minecraft on 60 fps with fancy graphics and 24 chunks of render distance; and it doesn’t even get hot! This is probably one of the best tech purchases I’ve ever made."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"What a great improvement over my old MacBook Pro. This is my third such computer. It keeps me in touch with the world and Amazon. What bugs me is the razzle dazzle passwords I must come up with to access other sites which is why I use Amazon almost exclusively There are so many goodies on this one that I will probably use only a few, though it is made for the new generation of users. Great product. Thanks Applel"
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"This Macbook was good until the screen started to glitch on the bottom and left side of the display. Apple said the screen didn't have damage, but needs to be replaced. It's 14 months old, outside of the one year warranty, and a new display costs $428. I will not be buying another Macbook in the future."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"Battery life is great, once you are not doing to much things. I had a glitch with the mouse the first day I bought it. But I have not seen it again from that day. It is portable, nice slim laptop, not heavy, work well so far. Camera quality is not so good, I think apple could have updated their camera quality, but it is fine anyways, usable. The speakers are loud and nice. Nice sound quality."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"I'm a mac guy and have been purchasing mac products for years.  I was taken back by the camera quality on this product.  It was strange that the 2015 macbook air that I sold before getting this 2020 version had a much better camera.  The camera quality is horrible.  It almost looks like a camera from 2001.  Other than that the product is great, and does what it needs to do."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"Work perfectly, worth money no cracks or anything wrong came perfect packaged"
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"I had tremendously high hopes for this CPU especially after reading the reviews of its 'speed', factually this is the slowest CPU I have ever used. The loading of web pages is truly pathetic, especially for 2021 and especially for the processor. The usual crap about speeding up the loading time is the usual garbage, 'clear the cache, is there enough room on the HD...' bla bla bla...' The damn thing is absurdly slow. The build quality is exceptional, the case is +, etc., and using the box offline is fine in terms of speed, but loading web pages, getting hung up on web pages, etc. is just plain BS. If anyone has any real advise on how to speed this thing up I would appreciate it but I am seriously thinking about returning it... My 2012 Lenova is actually faster. My INT is a fiber optics with plenty of juice..."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,Totalmente nuevo.
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,I ordered a mouse with the laptop but haven't even taken it out of the box because the trackpad is so good. The keyboard is sweet and I love the TouchId feature. I'm coming from a Windows background and this was so easy to set up. I'm so happy with it. The battery lasts a long time. Everything about this laptop is a breeze. Glad I took the plunge.
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"Beautiful computer, light weight,  sophisticated, very smart, great for school!!!!"
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"Este Portatil tiene muchas cosas buenas, entre ellas destaco la camara es mejor q la de mi anterior Asus y la rapidez que tiene para ejecutar las aplicaciones, apesar de solo tener 8GB es suficiente y la nitidez de las pantallas de Mac siempre son superiores- Dura bastante la bateria, (tampoco las 18 horas que dicen ellos, pero si mas de 8 horas)Desventajas: que solo tiene dos puertos ThunderboltLlego muy bien empacado hasta Colombia"
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"The M1 MacBook Air is my favorite portable Mac I’ve ever owned. It runs really great with the M1 chip. Battery Life is seriously all day. I normally go for the most RAM I can get, but went with the 8GB as Amazon had a sale and I don’t regret it. Can simultaneously run lots of Browser tabs, Slack, and all my other work apps with no sluggishness."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"This MBA is fan-TAS-tic to use. It can run unplugged all day. The speaker is sufficiently loud, and the hi-rez screen is eye-popping.But using a Mac laptop's USB-C port for power, after more than a decade of Mag-Safe bliss, is darn-near CRIMINAL. Thankfully, we still have capitalism, and there are a number of 3rd-party workaround devices that mimic Mag-Safe to a greater-or-lesser degree. Sigh."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"Wow!  came fast and brand new, thank you"
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"This is my first laptop my other Mac was a 21.5 desktop, so it has taken me a while to get used to it but I love it. It is light where I can take it from room to room. I do puzzles online and it took some time to figure how to make the screen just a little bigger but I am pleased with it. It is very fast andThe battery lasts quite a while I haven’t had an issue with it. Overall am very pleased with it."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"I am not computer savvy, but find this Mac to be easy to use.  I was limping along on a 12 year old MacBook Pro and could not even update to the new OS (Big Sur), so it was time.  I didn't need the big footprint of a MacBook Pro so this is a good fit.  I'm still finding my way around but so far, so good."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,Bought this for use while traveling. Does everything I need tho I am on a learning curve going from my windows machine at home.
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,I love this laptop it’s very light it’s very thin the screen is a great size not too big not too small the battery life is great Mine did not come with the touchscreen but I really don’t have a need for it the keyboard is perfectly fine I highly recommend this laptop I can’t say anything bad about it would buy it again
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"APPLE makes the best computers!  Reliable, there are no viruses, and they have the amazing APPLE CARE support for all their computers.  I also learned tat the only reason to purchase their separate Apple Care insurance is if you are concerned about the computer hardware, such as a broken screen.  APPLE makes all your tech needs easier and is my first and only choice."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"The touchpad is silky smooth, no need to buy another mouse at all, the sound quality is very nice, and the battery life is also very strong"
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,I bought what I considered to be a “Rose Gold” MacBook and it’s absolutely beautiful. It works just as well. I’m just Mac’ing away with course studies as well as my business. Now I can work at home or take it with me wherever I go. It’s light weight and the resolution is amazing. So much better than the laptop I was using.
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"No complaints so far - in fact, I am actually very impressed! The battery life is incredible (although I have only had it for two days!) and the screen, keyboard, and body are great. I had a Macbook Pro (2012) eons ago and this is obviously far and above that.I was a bit nervous buying from Amazon but I was impatient and couldn't wait the 2+ weeks it was going to take from Apple or Best Buy. It arrived quickly and in perfect condition."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"I'm an Apple girl, using apple products most of my adult life.  This is the best computer that I have purchased.  The updates that they have made have made these computers even faster, quieter, and more.  Due to the updates on the MacBook Air, you can do as much with Photoshop, InDesign, iMovie, PremierPro, and music programs that you can with the MacBook Pros, only more compact.  I would definitely encourage you to grab this one if you have the opportunity to."

Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"The only thing I can’t figure out , and I haven’t put much effort into it since I’m in the hospital is how to turn on the touch screen option. I thought it would be automatically on . Other than that I love my new MacBook Air Laptop and would recommend it to anyone looking for a laptop computer"
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"I’ve owned three MacBook Airs over the years and this is the most capable to date. Processing speed and battery life are excellent, and the screen is outstanding. I’m still getting used to having just two USB-C ports. I had to purchase an external hub to connect to an external monitor and an external hard drive and I especially miss not having a built in SDHC card reader."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"My first time MacBook experience, there are many things to learn, my iPhone and iPad  experiences helps, that is the Apple system, its shares so many apps, functionalities, the  M1 chip is amazing, laptop never got warm and I use it for three or four days without charging.I have migrated many window office documents to Mac, am still learning so far I'm impressed with the new Mac air. quality is top notch"
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,A plus quality as expected however no port outlets for other services
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,I love this computer. It is very light and easy to travel with. It is not air cooled so not hot bottom or the noise of a fan cooling system. Was super easy to set up.
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,Muy buen equipo
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,Very nice product. Brand new right out of the box
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,I never owned a Mac before and I am very pleased with this purchase. I was nervous about ordering it off Amazon at first but it was slightly cheaper and came in exactly two days. No issues with damages or overall quality. Screen quality/graphics are great. I am able to play most of the computer games I wanted to on here with no overheating issues. Battery lasts a while depending on what I am doing and charges very quickly.
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,Great product from Apple as usual
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"Had mine since April and I gotta tell you, I’m literally lost for words. I won’t make this length cause I don’t have to, all you need to know is that this is a must have for anyone wanting to get productivity and entertainment out of a laptop."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"Also I have been a Microsoft user for many many years, I decided to take the leap for a new OS and computer to expand my technology IQ and support for a new OS.I am impress by the small footprint-weight and especially the speed, resolution and ease of use with Mac OS Big Surf functionally. I would encourage anyone wanting to take the same leap- this the computer to start. I have evening carried over some my Windows OS applications- i.e. Office 0365- it works"
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"The media could not be loaded.
                



 I absolutely love it! Bought it because I’m a math major in college and it’s just what I needed! It charges fast and stays charged! I never shut my computer down but put it to sleep and battery is still good! I haven’t used it to it’s max ability so I’m not sure 100% of what it can and can’t do! It’s light and is gorgeous."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"I'm a Windows guy.  I bought this because I am creating a few apps.  The apps aren't ready; so I really haven't used it yet, beyond exploring for a few hours.  It's neither fast, nor large, by today's standards, but it is solid, light, and robust with Apple's latest release.  It'll last for years.No way to connect Apple's top products:  Mac Air and iPhone.  I guess I need more cables.  Please, sir, take more of my money."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,The display is wonderful. Touchpad is very responsive. I love the size and weight. Very easy to use anywhere
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"I absolutely love love my new lap top! I had a Macbook Air in college and now I have one for working at home and for traveling if the desire arises! The price is great and the quality is excellent, I noticed other reviews commenting on the quality of the video, however I do not see it being grainy at all!"
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,It was a very nice laptop! Loved the color. The specs was great. I am not very comfortable or familiar with Apple products. Returned for a refund and bought a Windows laptop. Really wanted to keep it but had a hard time figuring out how to use it.
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"What’s not to like? It’s a great Apple product! Bought to replace a 2013 MacBook Pro that worked flawlessly right up until it was destroyed in an accident. Setting it up and getting on with my life was pretty seamless, as it has been on every Apple product I’ve ever upgraded. I’m enjoying the increased speed and more up to date features as a bonus — especially longer battery life!"
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"This new Mac is more powerful than all previous versions, runs silent (no fans), dissipates heat under the heaviest of loads with no throttling, and does so while lasting 48 hours on a chafe and being almost as light as your phone.People taking about M1 being an issue either don’t know enough to figure it out or are straight lying. Everything works fine.If you’re looking to upgrade, you can’t go wrong with this."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"I tried to edit a 17 minute 4K60FPS video in Final Cut Pro. Yeah, that didn't happen. Somehow afterward my hard drive was basically full, and no matter how many files I deleted I could only get to 30 gig free max.Returning this and buying a M1 MacBook Pro with 32 gig of ram, which Amazon does not sell.If you just want to watch YouTube and browse the internet this is a fine computer. However, anything beyond that and you will be disappointed."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,Very good computer
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"found it complicated and deprecated quickly.  The purchase price for me was 1000 saw it at 90 less 2 months later now it's almost $200 less.  Don't feel too good about this,"
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"I put this along side my £3,500 13” MacBook Pro (2019), which was spec’d up to the max, and the M1 Air wiped the floor with it. Twice as fast encoding the same video, making my top of the line Intel MacBook Pro instantly obsolete. You can not go wrong with this purchase. This is the biggest evolutionary leap in desktop computing since the early 00’s. I’m just upset I bought this as a gift for someone else."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,I was a bit concerned when I saw the reviews saying that its camera was really bad because I teach online and do a lot of Zoom video calls. But it's so much better than my old PC laptop and might be as good as my iPhone 8 Plus camera. I am shook!
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"This computer was described as used but like new, I would have guessed it was new because it looks brand new. It's the latest MacBook Air and I got it cheaper than through the Apple store. I was anxious to get it but shipping said it could take 3-7 days from when I ordered it. I was pleasantly surprised to get it on the third day. This is replacing my 2013 MacBook Pro Retina. I love it."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"My husband bought me one for Christmas 2020 and my son loved it so we bought him one for Christmas 2021. Great laptop, great price for MacBook. Only thing is I wish it was a touch screen. Love it!!!"
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"Unexpectedly this turned out to be a espectacular laptop. Yes, some applications are still not available natively for the M1 chip but even through emulation they are very fast to use. Camera despite having the same.720p res it has a better image quality and I assume this is due to the chip processing image better than intel. For everyday use this is perfect for other tasks such as programming not yet."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"This is my first laptop and I’m real happy with the purchase. The speakers on this are nice and loud I love it. The size is a great size, not too big and definitely not too small, it’s just right. The screen is great too love the picture quality and it gets brights. I’m not super in tune with all the laptop lingo and things that matter but as a person who just bought their first laptop, definitely worth it."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"My wife likes it. Extremely overpriced for today's specs and she couldn't even play a Sims game from 2011 on it. . . But hey, she can edit pics. . . . For $1200. Paid for love, crapple product."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"I love its bootup sound and appearance BUT, it wont run any of my old software.  So what good is that?  Just because it purrs like a kitten it ain't worth a thing to me.  So that is why I am returning mine.  Unless you never owned a computer buy it.  Too reinvest in all the needed software whould be out of my price range."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"I'm absolutely stunned by this laptop, it's pefect in every way. Super fast with incredible screen quality and the outside color (rose gold) is beautiful!! It's extremely light and can be carried anywhere. I did get a protector because I was afraid to damage it since it's so light I felt like I could add a bit of protection so I put a clear plastic case and it still feels very thin and light."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,it works really well! the screen quality is very good and clear. I’ve been doing schoolwork on mine and it allows me to do things my other computer will not. overall a very beautiful laptop and great purchase! would recommend!!
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"First time owning a MacBook, I didn't want to cheap out on a good computer for school so I chose this and it does not fail to deliver. Very responsive and runs smooth when operating, I even don't mind using it without a mouse as it's trackpad is excellent. Crazy how this thing is so quiet. Very happy with the purchase!"
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,I’m a college student and bought this right before my semester started and it is my most favorite thing!! I was kind of hesitant it would be fake but it really is the real deal and I love my MacBook Air!
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,WINNER WINNER APPLE DINNER...it is a gem...software setup cumbersome but once done...it kicks assTHe trackpad lil stiff on clicking to select...guess breaking in will solve it...Rosetta 2 had to be installed..so it can run intel based apps..if you get pop up ...install it...had me goingBut for the money..it is fast..and installed new update...loads of preinstalled goodies...APPLE got this one right...the webcam they should have splurged on...they couponed out ..but good enough...3rd party apps will fix
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"Great lightweight laptop. Hard to get used to the new command keys if you are not an apple user already. Great migration operation from other laptops even windows applications.  Not easy to fix or troubleshoot when necessary. Had to get tech support to correct a bug with the M1 chip(hard drive), it was fixed but took an hour on the phone"
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"This is the first Apple computer I've ever had and I adore my Mac. I originally bought it for editing my videos for my YouTube channel (Rae of Sun Asmr) which is still its main function. Now however, I almost prefer watching things like Netflix, etc. on here vs on my actual television. Picture quality on this thing is superior. Highly recommend."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,The battery life in this laptop exceeds everything I've ever seen before. On a full charge after being on standby for a week I still have 90% battery left. In the past I've always been afraid to leave my laptop for any period of time without shutting it down. Now I never shut it down. an occupational reboot after an update or something is all it needs.
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,Have just opened and planning on taking to Apple store and have data transferred from old Mac Pro Book to the MacBoook Air.  It is much more sleek and lighter than the older Book Pro.  So far so good.
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"Other then battery life this thing is awesome. No complaints, lightning fast, never had a single problem with anything as of yet. Would like the battery to last more then a few hours but it could also be everything I have running on the computer. Overall I would recommend this to my friends and family"
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"Best computer i have ever had, very good job Apple. Comparing to many brands HP, Acer, Dell, etc this is a rocket based on price, speed, image, performance, everything. just the best buy you can ever have, dont doubt it for a second.Btw i rarely do reviews for stuff i buy but it deserves it, could not be happier!"
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"I have own a apple iPad and now this ,it is everything I could ask for in a laptop.I have own several other laptops made by different manufacturers and everyone failed me! this is far better and very easy to setup I had no problems setting it up at all! very pleased and would highly recommend this to anyone looking for a fast and powerful laptop!"
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"I just got my new macbook air and was super excited as it is my first ever mac computer, but it will not turn on! Hopefully I will be able to return it, but either way it is going to be a hassle. A big reason I bought this was that I was tired of my windows laptop taking forever on windows updates and often being slow, but at least that thing can turn on.Very disappointed with this I thought one of the big selling points with mac products was that they ""just work"". When I first opened it after it arrived, it would not turn on. I figured ok, I thought they come with some battery life but I guess I have to charge it. It turned on ONCE after charging it for a bit and then never again. After I went through the initial setup config I closed the laptop to let it finish charging. I came back an hour later and it would not turn on! I have tried charging it. I have tried plugging the charger into a different outlet. I have reseated the usb-c cable and tried both ports. I have held down the power button for 10+ seconds. I have tried hitting control + command + power. It doesn't do anything doesn't even make a boot up sound it just won't turn on. Looks like I am going back to a windows laptop I have never had one that completely doesn't work at least."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"I've only had it a few weeks, but I love it. I had an old one that couldn't be updated, so this is a great replacement. The sound quality is excellent."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"I am glad it finally came, took longer then advertised for shipping. Came with everything as advertised. No broken seals."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"My whole experience with ordering a MacBook off of amazon was amazing. It was smooth and easy, and showed up to my front door extremely early. I would venture to say that it was one of my favorite purchases and amazon made it that much easier. I would recommend for anybody to do this same thing."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,Amazon had the best price at the time. Great machine. The keyboard is sublime. There are plenty of online reviews on websites and YouTube. This machine truly hits the sweet spot.
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"This is replacing a 11 inch air that I spilled a beer on.  I pretty much love everything about it except the bigger size and heavier weight.  Battery life is amazing.  Speed, still hard to get used to.I loved the smaller size though."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,Great purchase
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,This MacBook is super fast and convenient to use. Typical Apple quality but yes you will have to pay a price for it.  The M1 chip is amazing and worth it.  Wish the bezels weren't as big but you can't get everything right?  Highly recommend if you are a fan of Apple. Very lightweight and portable.
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"I love my MacBook, battery is so good. Camera isn’t amazing but it’s pretty good, but you have to remember…. This is a laptop. Prefect for zoom!  So as long as your not taking your MacBook on a photo shoot, camera quality is great! Screen is small. But it’s fine! Lighter than a feather!"
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"FASTEST PERFORMANCE , LONG BATTERY LIFE, LIGHTWEIGHT,COMPACT, GREAT SECURITY FEATURES, TOO MANY THINGS TO LIST BUT THEN IT IS AN APPLE!"
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,First Mac laptop I’ve owned and I’m very impressed! Display colors are incredible. Processing speed with the M1 chip is amazing. Super long battery life and light weight. So much packed in a thin design!
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"Beautiful laptop. I’ve upgraded from the MacBook Air of old...so far this laptop has blown it away. It wasn’t overly pricey to be honest and I feel it’s worth the price. Overall look is great and keyboard feel is nice. Larger touchpad is great, I’ve paired my Magic Trackpad 2 with it as well."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"Bought this for my mom, she wanted to use a mouse. I gave her one of my old mouse. Where is the usb port? 20 more dollars for an addon for usb ports!, 720 camera still on a 2020 product come one!Everything else is great. wow, woah"
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,Love this computer! I am a PC user switching to Mac for the first time! The computer comes in perfect condition and extra boxes for additional protection.It also arrived so quickly even when it was Black Friday. Thanks Amazon!
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"The m1 MacBook Air is the perfect machine blending the best aspects of cell phone computing with the functionality of a laptop. This means unparalleled performance, amazing battery life, and beautiful screen quality. Along with these improvements the keyboard is also refined and no longer used the dreaded scissor mechanism. The only improvement I could ask for is the webcam."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,Such a high quality and well-built piece of computing equipment. The M1 processor is a huge leap forward.
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"Unbelievable difference from my prior Air. So much faster. I have run into a couple of small issues with software due to the new chip, but I'm sure they'll release new versions soon. The main one for me right now is that Google FIle Stream doesn't work. I found a substitute called odrive which works to sync w/ Google, but it is a paid product. Hope that's fixed by Google soon."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"I returned this MacBook Air very quickly. The default  font on most everything was too small, and there was limited/or no capacity to use zoom in effectively."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,Best price-quality MacBook in the history of Apple.
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"This is a very good computer. Very fast and works with most people.... but, some apps just don't work. They used to work in my other Macbook pro. but on this M1 it simple won't work.... apps like Google drive!!!! for good sake!Even worst... trying to return... 15% restocking fee.Serious Amazon?!"
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,Never owned a Mac and now never going back to Windows.  So smooth and fast with phenomenal battery life up to 8+ hours. Great screen as well with backlit keyboard. Easy to transfer files from Windows.  This is money well spent replacing a 5+ years old slow heavy HP laptop!
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"I love, love, love this computer. I just love the fact of having everything in the cloud. When I try to look at some file that I was working on my MacBook from my phone, it will come up quickly and fast. Everything is synced. Love the keyboard, the features, the color and texture of it, will definitely stay with Apple!"
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"Amazed that it uploaded all my files and I for from cloud. Just turned it on and it worked, syncing with phones and iPad 👏👏👏👏"
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"Upon receiving my new Mac, which I waited days for, I questioned the condition of the box.  Apple has very nice packaging but this looked beat up and worn.  I did need to call technical support for something and found out by providing the serial number that my “new” Mac Air was already out of the 90 day warranty.  I received a used computer.  With the price I paid, this kinda makes my blood boil. This one is going back and i WILL get a new one in return."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"I am not a computer nerd, I use my computer to finish charts from work when I am at home or to just browse the web so the MacBook Air was all I needed. I love the screen, the keyboard, size, and weight."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"Needless to say, I love my Macbook Air. This is the first time I purchased a laptop that's apple. I have owned one in the past, but it felt good actually purchasing my own this time. Now I not only have an Ipad, Apple Watch, Apple phone but I now have an Apple Macbook Air."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,I ordered the Macbook to use for my model railroad.  I now use it as my portable computer.  it is small and powerful........
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"Did not like the color. The gold is NOT gold, rather rose gold. So this is a misrepresentation on the color. If you think it will be true gold color, you will be disappointed. It looks and is rose gold has a pink color to the gold."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,Super duper awesome
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"The connections are really lacking on this laptop, but everything else is consistent with what you'd hope from an Apple product. Over priced, but good quality and decent support. Buy the additional warranty or Apple care."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,I am extremely happy with this purchase! The screen quality is amazing and it seems like I never need to recharge it. I got a great deal on it and the genius at the Apple store told me it was a great model so that did it for me!
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,Love it
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,Needed a laptop with more capabilities for school and it fits the bill I haven’t had no issues with it and it works great and fast.
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"Everything was perfect for the shipping to the packaging! Easy set up, super nice."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,Quality of item was state-of-the-art. Delivery was exceptional. Elegant packaging. Seller is first-rate and choice.
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"I bought this to replace a 2015 MacBook Pro, and it’s worked out great. Better screen and better battery life. Much faster processor. Also much thinner and lighter yet I can use my existing laptop sleeve. Happy with this."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"The item is great, allows me to be productive without worrying about performance being an issue. It was shipped quickly and arrived at my front door just 5 days after purchasing. Highly recommend this laptop for those who don’t need the highest specs but, can get by doing mostly everything you throw at it just fine."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"You get what you pay for, and that $1000 I dropped on this MacBook was worth. I went through a few cheap laptops that went from $200-400 bc I needed it for my college classes and then after wasting my time buying and returning them,  I finally decided to go all out and no regrets with this purchase. 10/10"
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"Almost everything is top-notch: Performance, battery life, new magic keyboard, usual unparalleled trackpad, quality of materials and build. I was a little concerned about lower screen brightness of MB Air versus MB Pro prior to purchase, but have no complaints. Only feature less than excellent is camera, which is only 720p. Limited ports only a minor inconvenience. Most highly recommended."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,Amazing system but run into issue so had to return the product.
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,I recommend others to buy it and It's perfect for school
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,I absolutely love this MacBook!! It has a finger print scan to unlock it and to fill in passwords which is so handy. The battery life lasts for a long time. The screen quality is flawless. It’s super fast and comes with so many useful apps on it!
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,Work and play
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"The M1 chip is amazing and a miracle, this little chip can play some of the most cpu demand games around cities skylines it played phenomenal without any lag or freezing. This MacBook Air is very powerful. the downside to it, is that it doesn't have a cooling fan and one cooling fan in it would make a major improvement."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"El rendimiento del equipo es genial, la duración de la batería es asombrosa, cumple con todas funciones descritas, lastima que solo tiene 2 puertos tipo C, pero con la compra de un Hub se soluciona el problema. En resumen una muy buena adquisición de mi parte."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"This computer is a good buy and works very well. My only complaint is that I have been a pc user all of my life (more than 60 years) and I am having some challenges with the OS. Not their fault. Delivery, packaging, speed, and everything seems really good. I am satisfied."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,this is a great laptop for everyday use. love the build quality. the screen and speakers are amazing. I love how fast this laptop is. the thin and light weight of it is amazing.
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"Best investment I could have made for my business! I’m still adjusting to Apple computers, as I’m transitioning out technology from Windows. But this computer has cut my time for work, and photography projects, down so much! Tasks that used to take me 3 hours, only take 1 now.🤨🙌🏾"
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,Blazing fast!  This was my first Mac and I was Only familiar with iOS devices so I can compare to past models. But I can say that the MacBooks with the M1 chips our as fast as an iPad when it comes to light duty things.
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,Absolutely wonderful and showed up charged and. ready to go. Make sure you migrate everything from your older Mac or have a solid time machine backup to transfer. Only downfall is it has no USB ports. Buy your year’s version of a Macbook Air to USB port and/or HDMI adapter at a minimum.
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,Get this computer for all intents and purposes! I bought it for IT and database administration and I just wanted a computer who could think for me. This is it. Along with its long computer time and screen life
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,There's nothing to dislike the laptop comes with own software ready to turned it on and start using it
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,This has been the best purchase I have made in a very long time. My computer can go days without needed a recharge and has a sheik finish. I have shared this link with many already. The greatest of all is that it last for years!
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"Currently writing this review on the laptop Everything about it is amazing. This could be the best laptop ever made by apple as the m1 chip is mind-blowingly fast. Keyboard and touchpad feel are amazing. Convenience is unmatched with all of the built in features that work seamlessly. For students, there's no better option for this great of a value."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,This is a replacement for my 11 year old MacBook Pro that still works but I’m glad to have this new MacBook Pro Air. It’s battery life is far better that my old one and I am enjoying its much lighter weight. Amazon’s price was the best I could find and with my Prime Chase card I am buying it interest free.
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"This laptop is great. It's fast, slim and battery life is pretty awesome. The camera isn't the best and I don't love Apple's new keyboards, they have very little travel. Besides that I'm very pleased with my purchase."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"This review is for a brand new Apple MacBook Air with Apple’s M1 processor. I got it here on Amazon for $200 less than what they sell for on Apple’s website. I bought it to replace my 10 year old MacBook Pro that has performed flawlessly. Unfortunately this new MacBook Air was defective from the start. It would crash frequently with this weird pink screen of death. It would come back up with a MacOS kernel panic log.  I would also get the spinning beach ball. And it would randomly reboot itself, even when I wasn’t using it. We can only speculate on why this MacBook Air was such a good deal. Returning it for a refund was not easy and required a phone call to Amazon then a scheduled pickup from my home with an adult."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"My old MacBook Air lasted 8 years and died a peaceful death. Even so, Apple gave me $130 credit for it. It’s so wonderful to have a new one!"
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,Honestly all I know is that my daughter loves it and thats all that matters to me!
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"This item was very horrible! The touch screen never worked , it was overpriced and it was defected and AMAZON ONLY TOLD ME I WOULD GET 80% of what I paid for this product back ! That’s bs . They are keeping almost $300 of what I paid for a defective product  I returned my computer for refund for defects. I have been disrespected, condescended, lied to by customer service over and over again over this return. They say calls are recorded for customer service satisfaction. They lie. After being guaranteed by a supervisor that I would receive my complete amount of purchase refund , and waived as a one time courtesy the restocking fee, I would have no problem with this ; all I would have to do is call back after they initiated the first part of the refund when they received the computer back—- and on another call to see what was the status because it had been the time for them to have received the computer back already, another customer service assured me that it was noted again he saw as a one time courtesy I would receive the waived restocking fee, I would just need to wait again until Monday . This didn’t happen, they were rude, condescending and denied it was noted and hung up on me."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,I have been a Mac user for a long time and this one is certainly up to standards. Got some great help from Mac setting it up and ended the frustrations of my old one.
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,Llego en excelente estado
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,I love it. This is my first IOS computer and I’m in love. The quality put into it is top notch. This is my primary computer for school and everyday use. It’s well worth the investment!!
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,First MacBook and I am in love! I have been using my computer for two days and still have 60% battery life. Very impressive because I have been using it a lot. I’m still getting use to the different feel on how to use it but it really is self explanatory once you start using it.
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"Nowhere was it mentioned that this is the castrated 7 GPU Core version. Feeling deceived. In addition, the 8 GB RAM / 256GB SSD Version is nigh useless for anything beyond websurfing. Having multiple apps open concurrently almost immediately yields the spinning beach ball of death. With a regular set of apps, like the MS Office suite, the disk fills up in no time. Now OS updates are not working, since they require at least 15 GB disk space. But - battery life is out of this world, with the CPU temp sitting at 36C!"
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"I've chewed through 2 MacBook Pros in the last 12 years but this MacBook Air is the best out-of-the-box laptop yet. The keyboard is amazing. The track pad is indescribably good--they've always been good but...damn. The Activity Monitor is back and it's a icon on the dock. Yay!Also, Amazon knocked it out of the park. I ordered free shipping on Friday and received on Monday morning before I left for work. Everything was well packaged. 5 stars for Amazon on this one. It's nice to be able to say something nice about them for a change. :)Damn. I forgot to add that Apple is a corporation that fluffs totalitarian dictatorships and actively engages in slave labor and censorship. All is good in lefty bubble world, right?"
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,Powerful laptop that can handle music production and djing softwares without problems. This computer is so light and thin that it is unbelievable how well it works.There is no need to buy a Macbook Pro M1. Shop this one without hesitation.
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"Everything is so snappy.Great screen, amazing battery life.Windows users, do not hesitate on getting this. After more than 10 years using windows and in certain years of college Mac OS, this runs like a f1 car.Trust me, if you want to buy a new laptop, this is it."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,Best laptop i’ve ever owned 🫶🏼
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,Personal use - replaces my previous MacBook Air.Great improvements to a classic.
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"Love my new Mac !  It’s very light, battery lasts a long time. Days even - with light use.  Charges quickly too.  I haven’t bought a case yet - it’s too gorgeous to cover up!  But will buy a sleeve for transporting when I travel. No complaints.  LOVE IT."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,The solid state drive makes this laptop a speed demon!  Ultra rite screen. The laptop hardly weighs anything at all. Charges really fast. Holds charge a long time. Great keyboard and easy bluetooth connection to my trackball. Really nothing to complain about.
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"Llego hasta las puertas de mi caso en un estado excelente como si lo hubiera comprado en una tienda, vino sellada, es parecida es l software y su arreglo a las otras Mac igual de organizadas, trabaja bastante rápido, pero hay que reconocer que la calidad de la cámara es menor que las generaciones anteriores."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,The MacBookAir does not have a touch screen and I don't use it for gaming. It is a great notebook just as it is.
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"First venture into Mac. Laptop has some heft to it with a nice aluminum chassis. Screen is sharp, very bright and responsive. Keyboard is on par with other laptops I use daily (Lenovo). Blows standard laptops out of the water with battery life."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"My first Apple product. Great hardware and software. Coming from Windows Lifer, it had been no problem getting upto speed on Big Sur. Got it on promotion too for 850. No brainer.Best laptop purchase I ever made."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,Llegó en algo menos de dos días. Está Macbook air M1 es lo mejor de lo mejor. La capacidad de memoria es asombrosa. La rapidez parece indicar que Apple se ha adelantado muchos años.
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,Computer is lightweight and fast but... right out of the box I had a service battery notice. Charged it up and it was still there. Made an appointment with the nearest Apple store (20 miles away). They confirmed my Mac was made this month so it was brand new but they can’t replace it since it was bought from Amazon and not Apple. They sent it out for a new battery under warranty which was to take 3-5 days and they have had it a week now and haven’t completed the repair yet. All around not a good experience for my first Mac and spending a thousand bucks on a laptop. I’ll be going back to pc after this.
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"This computer lived up to and surpassed my highest expectations. I could not recommend it more. The battery life is surreal. The screen is gorgeous. It is snappy, fast, and outperforms my much more expensive previous gen Macs. Such an incredible feat of engineering."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"Attractive gold colour that looks like rose gold, lightweight, speedy. Ideal for browsing the internet, reading emails, Microsoft Office. Purchased brand new from the Apple Store on Amazon - ""Ship and Sold by Amazon"". Received in pristine condition with one year Apple Warranty."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,Got it for my daughter for school. I asked her after she spent some time with it- how is it? Her response was- I LIKE IT!!! That answers all my questions! That's all I want to know. Apple 🍎👌
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"YOU WILL NEVER REGRET THIS PURCHASE IF YOU ARE A MAC PERSON.  IT IS GOOD FOR PC PERSONS AS LONG AS THEY ARE WILLING TO TAKE A LITTLE TIME TO LEARN HOW TO USE IT, AS IT IS DIFFERENT FROM A PC.  SOME SOFTWARE IS MORE DIFFICULT TO FIND."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"I have to reset this thing at least 5 times per week in the middle of meetings and such for no reason. I've done all the updates and it's brand new, it just doesn't work. I'm guessing this has to do with the fact that it has an Apple chip instead of an Intel one, and like most things Apple actually makes its glitchy and unreliable. Makes sense that it was on sale. If you have to buy an Apple try to get the ones that have the fewest Apple parts as possible."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,Completely closed and never used. Excellent but excellent laptop. Great investment
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,I was skeptical at first but now I’m convinced!  ARM Is like the cpu in the terminator movies! lol. No fan and battery last all day easily!  It absolutely crushes my 6 core i7 MacBook Pro on Geekbench test!  You will not regret buying one!  Look at the picture and see for yourself!
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,It was time to update a pc laptop and and took the plunge and switch to an apple product. It's a great system and works well with my other apple products ie iPhone/AirPods. I especially like the fingerprint function. Nothing to complain about for this user.
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"I had a MacBook Pro that is over ten years old and has served me well, but it was time to upgrade. Happy so far, the light weight is awesome, keyboard is excellent and quiet, so far so good!"
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"Wonderrful upgrade, easy to migrate and Amazon delivered as promised."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"I purchased a MacBook Air (Late 2020) from Amazon on September 17th.  After a week of use, the screen has lines on it.  Before the 30-day return window was up, I brought it to the apple store (twice).  The Apple Store, would not replace the unit and the staff would not send the unit out to be fixed at no cost. The store claimed “damage” was done to the laptop.  An unacceptable response where the laptop was used over a week with normal use, on a desk. This is a defect, not “damage”.  Additionally, employee at the Apple Store, said that he could only “swap it out” if we purchased it from Apple directly.  This is unacceptable, I purchased this unit from Amazon which is an authorized Apple Retailer.  The same policies need to be applied, or why bother having authorized retailers.The screens on the M1 MacBook Airs are fragile and are of poor quality.  Apple won’t stand behind its product and fix it. Amazon will take back the laptop and I’m getting a full refund.  Apple needs to address the screen issue on their laptops, improve their warranty and retrain staff.  The M1 MacBook Air has poor components, poor warranty and the Apple staff are not handling these issues well.  Apple is blaming customers for Apple’s poor build quality."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"I've needed a new laptop for years and finally decided to buy one, but had not planned on purchasing a MacBook.  After reviewing many options I clearly made the right choice.  I love it!!!DW"
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"Great laptop, feels so premium. Fast enough for common use and the battery mas a lot, I have to charge it every three or four days."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,Was bought as a graduation gift for my daughter. Display quality and sound from the built in speakers is exceptional. She currently  only uses it for Netflix and YouTube until college starts in a few weeks though lol.
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,No need to say anything
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,This thin laptop is attractive and works efficiently.  Great graphics.
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"I love my Mac book Air.  Very easy to use.  I love that everything goes to iPhone, iPad and Mac book and I don't have to do anything.  I have not began to use all of the 100's of features.  Extremely pleased."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,Beautiful and looks really nice.  Quality looks like true Apple quality.  Battery life is respectable.  No touch screen but keyboard makes it easy to use
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,I LOVE this laptop.  The new Apple M1 processor is lightning fast and the graphics are out of this world.  I also love the top of the line wifi card. All for just over $1K
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"Love this lap top but it’s ridiculous that it doesn’t have an usb or hdmi, so if you plan to buy MacBooks then get the adapter too. Otherwise you won’t be able to connect your phone to your laptop."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"I’ve had the same MacBook Pro for 7 years and it was finally time to get a new one. I wasn’t sure about the Air, but I’m so happy I went with it! Not a bad price, shipped very quickly, battery lasts a long time, I just love it."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,Great value and device my youngest daughter loves it.
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,M1 processor performs great.  Would rate a 5 if I could run my iPad applications.  Limited apps compared to iPhone and iPad.  Hopefully this will improve.
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"So I have never bought any Apple laptops off Amazon but it did arrive wrapped and packaged as if it came from Apple itself. Battery life is great, keyboard is great and it’s light. I don’t use laptop cameras so I can’t say either way on how good it is or isn’t."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"This MacBook was the best purchase I made this year. Highly recommend! The battery lasts for days,  the magical keyboard is so helpful writing at night. Very sleek design, the Touch ID is so convenient, you won’t regret getting this laptop. Only recommendation I have would be to get more storage."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"Upgraded from my 2014 MacbookAir b/c it was slowing down. This 2020 MacbookAir started out great, but within 3 weeks it's slowing down too! Display is more or less fine. Front camera quality seems to have deteriorated somewhat. But trying to open applications, download/upload files, etc . . . is getting slow now and it's annoying."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"Really love my mac, but when it's arrived there is some stink out of it. I guess these Mac's are being kept at a damp warehouse or something."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,I love this laptop.  I was a die-hard PC / Android person prior but my experience with this product is really pushing me to the Apple world... Also the keyboard rules compared to the old butterfly keyboard they had previously.
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"If you're a heavy user, go for the 16 gig model. The 8 gigs 8s good enough for day to day task, plus the battery is unbelievable.  Easily goes for 2 days without worries"
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"It's an apple product, so it always lives up (or even surpasses) the expectation. My daughter loves the color and the size. Now I feel like I need one myself!"
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"This laptop is awesome. Lightweight, beautiful screen, and fast as lightning. I was worried about apple’s new m1 processor but my fears have been put to rest. It’s fast and can handle big jobs without getting hot."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,Excelente servicio y maquina vino en perfecto estado
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"beautiful laptop, powerfull, slim. not like their phones lol."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"I'm a PC person not so PC. Bought this for daughter and this new m1 chip crushes PC in several important areas. Battery life, encoding and transcoding. Apple is crushing it in After Effects and the Adobe Suite WITHOUT an impossible to find expensive unicorn video card."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"Aun no cumple un año, la camara esta pixelada, un día de repente se estropeó el display y recien se me acaba de salir una tecla y no me funciona. No se golpeo ni nada, de la nada.Yo tenia una mac del 2012 q funcionaba perfecto, solo la cambie porque se me cayo jugo encima, pero sino era por ese accidente seguia años. Era fan de mac, y ahora estoy muy muy desilusionada, hacen todo para q no dure nada y lo tenga q cambiar. No la recomiendo mas! Yo contacte a soporte y ni bola me dieron, queria extender la garantia y no se puede porque claramente saben q falla. No compro mas una mac, lamentablemente tendre que mudar de marca porque yo pagaba con gusto por un producto de excelencia q duraba años, pero que se rompa tanto en menos de un año ... Q pena que hayan bajado la calidad de esta manera."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,Top quality computer
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,I only have one thing I didn’t like.... it actually has nothing to do with the computer!I LOVE the computer but when the delivery guy destroyed our yard because they drove through it and got stuck is really aggravating! This is NOt the first time they have done this! And we have asked multiple times NOT to do it! We have multiple areas where Amazon workers have drove in our yard and messed it up!  They tell us that they will fix it but never do! My mother in law  and father in law are pissed so be prepared for a call from them :-)
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"I spent a lot of time reviewing different brands, models, prices, GB, and this one definitely was exactly what I needed!! So far, so good I got it 2 days ago and it runs very smoothly."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"Like every Apple product, this is top notch. The original M1 chip is clearly outstanding, the speeds are phenomenal, and the batter life is tremendous. Certainly no complaints here!"
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"Idk why I’d expect for it to be any less than perfect , for the price I paid it just better had been !!! Lol it’s just what I wanted .. I totally forget about my phone because I’m so happy about my new labtop! Lol💞"
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,Very fast. Should come with a converter for USB.
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,As usual I am really impressed with the  product and also the efficiency on handling my purchase.....the United States  post office really should look at Amazon and Apple on how to run a business! ....just saying....
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,Bought the 8 gig ram model works great. Unless you’re running a lot of concurrent apps you don’t need 16 gig. This machine is fast and beautiful. By far the best laptop I found and believe me I thought a lot of them during the last 40 years!
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"I tried several other higher cost laptops. Namely Windows based.  I was dissatisfied, display resolution was lacking, battery life, etc...  Looked at the new MacBook Air and purchased it.  I am satisfied with it, no regrets!!!  Seems like it was created by people in the future! ;)"
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,I'm not to fond of the lack of a USB port forcing people to have to by additional accessories
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"I'm a PC guy, not a apple fanboy. Credit where is deserved though, Apple does make nice if overpriced devices. It definitely has the best screen of any laptop I've bought. The M1 battery life and performance is quite impressive for a laptop for this size and price. Keyboard is good too. Points deducted for apple pulling it's usual crap.... Only 8 gigs of ram and 256 of storage. Lack of ports too."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"The best purchase i could ever made, worth the money! The great choice for the price, instead of the Macbook Pro. Incredible Weight, Screen, speed processing, performance and look."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,It’s an Apple. That really says it all.
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,I use this product for work.
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"With my current Apple computer showing it’s age, buying a new Apple MacBook was a know brainer. It is convenient, easy to use, fits into my Apple world and it is an Apple."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"I finally bought a Mac after years of Dells, ASUS, and HPs, and I am never going back. Absolutely worth the money."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"So far this has been a wonderful purchase. The processor is so fast, that’s what I noticed the most is how fast it is. Super excited to get the M1 ship at such a discounted rate."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"This is my first MacBook and I like it for the price, but touchbar isa bit weird. As i find out this is not fault apple just have this kind of touchbars. I had acer predator helios 300 before this and it has much better toucbar. Much comfortable in every aspect."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,Just like the picture ♥️
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"this item is very good. I buy it for my son who is going to college in Shouth DAKOTA  at MOUNT MARTY university, He is happy and am happy for him."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,As expected from an Apple. Perfect désigne smooth experience of setting up the laptop. Pure joy.After years of work dell it’s nice to go back to my apple
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,My great grandson uses this for online schooling. Perfect. He is very happy.
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"I absolutely love this computer. It is attractive, feels nice and works perfect as all apple products."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"I’m really happy with this purchase because I’ve wanted a MacBook for a long time and when I finally wanted to save up for it the day I bought it, it went to 899 and I was happy"
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,Finally got my MacBook Air. So far so good. Value for money. I have used windows all my life. My first MacBook. Will share an update.
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,It’s amazing. It has everything I need and more to be able to stay on track from day to day life. It’s by far the best to me out there right now
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,Great computer… came packaged very nicely. Good purchase.
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,Love it!! I ordered it last night and it arrived this morning! Super efficient delivery and the product came intact! Thank you Amazon! The laptop is very sleek looking and light to carry. I have found it very user friendly and super customizable! Definitely recommend. :)
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"This is the second MacBook I’ve owned. The first one lasted 11 years. Apple makes a quality product. The MacBook Air is lightweight, responsive and excellent graphics. I continue to invest in only Apple products."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,Amazing laptop! Switched to this when my HP Pavilion crashed and I don’t regret it. Easy to maneuver and it connects right to your iPhone to make things nice and smooth.
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"Love my new MacBook Air!! Light, sleek, long lasting battery, plug & play! Surprised it does not have regular USB ports, but ordered 2-pack of USB to USB-C adapters for $10. Love all my Apple products from their packaging to their long lasting durability and fantastic performance/technology."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"Love the lightweight and easy to set up/configure capabilities.  This is my first MAC although I have iPads and an Apple watch.  Though it might be scary to move from Windows, but not at all.  Like all Apple products - everything was seamless.  Great price as well.."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,This Mac is the fastest that I have had. Wakeup is instant. The fingerprint reader is exceptional. Screen quality is tops. Connectivity to external devices is simple and easy. Very satisfied
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,Enjoying the fingerprint feature of this new MAC air. Loading is quick with the new Apple M1 chip.Wish I could use a mouse instead of touchpad. Did that on prior models over the years.
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,I love this Mac! It stays charged for what seems like forever. I’ve had no issues with it and while I’m lesson planning I have lots of windows open. It is very easy to use. I never worry about covering the fan while I’m trying to comfortably work. It’s affordable and quality.
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"Received clean, neat, well packaged and on time. Lovely system"
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,I love that this laptop is lightweight and the perfect size. Thought it was going to be much smaller but thankfully it was just right!
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,Beautiful device. Perfect for simply web browsing and ideal for teachers like myself that need to use Microsoft Office and Google Classroom etc. Definitely worth every penny. Treat yourself if you’ve been debating this over a PC laptop.
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,M1 chip is faster than core i5. I see there is quite a big difference in machine handling concurrent applications at a time. Really nice improvement by Apple.
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,Love this computer !
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,Exceeded all expectations.  Amazing entry level Mac.
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,I’ve had a 2012 MacBook Pro and it’s still running good just a lil slow. Now to upgrade to this MacBook Air not a big difference but runs way smoother
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"The cámara it’s really good , so I just had my first problem with it I was doing homework and the screen started glitching so let’s see what happen"
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,This was exactly what I was looking for. Got the beautiful Rose Gold colored edition which had been sold out in stores every time I looked. Fast delivery that arrived a day earlier than expected. Everything I wanted with no hassles.
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,I have zero complaints. I’ve always heard wonderful things about Apple computers.  I wish I made this purchase a long time ago. Would have avoided headaches and could have saved myself a lot of money on cheap laptops.
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,Perfect perfect perfect. Nothing damaged and I got it for a good price! 100 dollars off at the time.  Thank you ❤️❤️❤️
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,It’s perfect and fast shipping
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,Nice computer
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"Screen quality  “SUPER ULTRA HD” Battery life “Excellent “ 7 (hours still not less than 90%.). Camera quality “Distinction”. I like everything about it including the light weight, sleek style and many more. It’s my ultimate working assistance."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,I bought this for mygrand daughter who loves it!Ll
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,Everything that Apple does is top of the line and you can’t do any better.
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"I had given this a few months since release for some of the software compatibility issues to be straightened out, and was encouraged by reviews. However, there are significant unresolved issues from the hardware side of things: 1. there is a known problem with disk usage related to RAM disk swap (from what I understand) and media-heavy usage (why I bought this laptop) deteriorates the SSD quickly. 2. the FaceTime camera is absolutely terrible. There is no other way to put this. It may be the worst camera I have seen on any device since my iPhone 3G. The picture is incredibly blurry, and not suitable for the COVID/virtual environment. There have been issued raised about this in Apple support forums with no resolution.Unfortunately my return window has passed, but I would not recommend this machine to anyone. Really thought Apple had turned a corner with their new processor, but ended up being stuck with a bunch of other systems that weren't upgraded. 2/10"
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,Bough this for my mom. Battery life is great & it’s so sleek that we can take it anywhere without it taking up space. also the price for this is great I couldn’t find a better deal anywhere else.
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"After a month of usage, the keyboard does not respond accurately, it repeats different keys and numbers. The delete key sometimes work sometimes it does not. I tried refreshing and it did not work. I had to send it get checked to see what the problem is. I think is hardware. Bad luck! If you can, pay international warranty coverage."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"This was a gift for Christmas for my daughter who will be graduating in May 2021 and going off to college.  So, I wish I could give more feedback on it, my oldest has a bigger apple laptop and loves it for her school assignments she’s in a nursing program."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"I only charge it every few days, battery is awesome on it so far. Still getting used to using a Mac after only ever having a windows laptop but so far so good."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"A windows user now with first Mac, very nice, processing video and photographs are excellent. It's light weight and no fan equals no noise!"
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"I absolutely love this computer and all of it's features! It was well protected and packaged throughout the shipment, so I didn't have any damage to my new computer when I received it."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,She use for job

Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,It is everything I wanted  in a laptop. It’s easy to use .All you have to do from the box is open the lid and your up and running
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"This low-end MacBook Air performs incredibly. It handles Lightroom and Photoshop like it's nothing. I can't believe the battery life as well - it'll run all day. I don't know how Apple did it, but they did. Very satisfied with this laptop."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,It may replace my iPad Pro 11” based on my use so far.
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"The configuration is not high, but the running speed is very fast.Convenient for home and office!"

Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,I went everywhere attempting to purchase this MacBook. I couldn't even get it from apple since there's no in-store purchasing .. I was able to find and recieve within 1 day via amazon. As for the laptop itself Wonderful ... If you're considering I highly recommend.

Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"Such a great laptop! I got this to replace my horrible PC and Chrome book, because they lag so much. This laptop is so compact and lighting fast! Such a great investment!"
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,I love my new laptop the only draw back is that I have to purchase a USB-C to connect my phone.. other from that everything works well so far
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,Disliked mot knowing there are not many apps made for the Mac book.  Guess that’s why I hung onto my other windows computers
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,This computer met all my expectations. Came well packaged and shrink-wrapped and is definitely new and in perfect  condition. I love the color and the screen quality is wonderful.
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"I use it everyday for my Red Cross volunteer work. Gets tricky switching between my MAC, iPad & iPhone but that’s on me. I wished more apps were compatible over PCs."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,I love MAC laptops. They are reliable and this one has the newest processor which is very fast and the screen has no frame. The only issue that this causes is a lot of finger smudges from opening it or adjusting the screen.
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,Works super fast. Brilliant screen and multitasking isn't a problem even with my $20.00 internet connection.
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,Good product. Shipped quickly and arrived earlier than expected.  Highly recommend.

Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,Got it quickly and am blown away at how great it has been so far. It’s as powerful as everyone says it is and battery seems to last quite as long as well. Big upgrade from my old one.

Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,I am extremely happy with the MacBook Air but more impressed with the simplicity and efficiency of the Amazon ordering process.  The lengths Amazon has gone to provide an incredible purchasing process is impressive.  Amazon has a customer for life
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,This laptop couldn’t keep up with the multiple tabs I usually have open for work or school.
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,Amazing
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,Bought this for my daughter and now my wife wants one too!Very thin and light weight.
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,This little puppy gets the job done at half the price of the bigger one. Great deal from Amazon.

Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,This MacBook is amazing. I have been waiting years for apple to get away from intel. The M1 chip is amazing. The battery lasts all day. If you are on the fence about a new laptop it’s time to make the leap.
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"It's a great computer, very sturdy and strong. You have to take good care of it, though, if you get little crumbs inside the keyboard, it'll obviously stop working. Also, the gold color isn't really gold, it's more of a pink shade."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,New M1 chip is fast! great performance for normal everyday tasks... overpriced as usual.
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,M1 chip blows away any laptop on the market. It even blows away the pro version of this laptop. No internal fan and loss of efficiency is virtually non existent. Highly recommend
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"Good value,I  use it for music productionJust get a 16Gb memory for a better experience."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,Excelente computadora. Las características son las solicitadas y llegó en el tiempo estimado. Vale la pena el cambio a chip m1.

Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"We bought this computer out of insistence from my husband. He knew I wasn't an Apple/Mac fan, but this computer had made reconsider everything related to electronics. It's fast, efficient and simple."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,Took a chance on an $899 MacBook Air. Figured it was a refurb (since it’s typically $1299). But it was brand new. Shirnkwrapped and all!
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,BLACK SCREEN OF DEATH WITH 2 of These Computers !!! DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY!! Garbage!!!
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,I’m very satisfied. It works good and fast better than my imac(late 2013). But the camera is little poor.
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,I don’t use it much I’m starting online college in the next few months. It’s my first Apple laptop so I’m pretty happy with it. I do use it at times and it never heats up.
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"Saying I love my new MacBook Air is an understatement.  It was super easy to set up, processes quickly and the battery life lasts a long time.  Arrived quicker than anticipated and the gold color is beautiful in person."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,This laptop is better than I expected. I highly recommend this laptop to anyone in the market of purchasing one

Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,That battery life is on point. It has listed me days with my normal use. I can’t really speak to camera quality. I haven’t been using it. Screen quality is good.
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,Excelent.
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,Good price and good delivery
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,I like that it is small and compact and easy to use.  Using it daily for many hours and hardly drains the battery at all.

Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"Meet and exceed all my expectations Makes my 2010 MacBook Pro,2015 Macbookpro and 2015 IMac feel obsolete. My old iPhone app like my Q-See camera app can now be opened on my M1 wow"
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"it's a great product, the battery the best of all, I charge it every 2 days with heavy use."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,I am absolutely in love with my new computer. Still getting used to the commands of a MAC but I love it.
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,Works great!  Rosetta makes installing old Mac apps easy.  Performance is amazing at a relatively affordable (for Apple) price.  Best MacBook to be released in some time.
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,Great laptop! Nice and easy to work!
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,The Best part of the Mac is the battery life. Not to take away from its sleek design and extremely light weight.
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"This might be one of the best MacBooks currently in the market, but it has limited functionality compared to Windows PCs and even certain Chromebook features. The MacBook Air has a beautiful screen but no touchscreen support. It also has an excellent trackpad. However, the MacBook doesn't allow you to perform certain basic features without paying for additional software to access them. For example, you can't snap multiple windows next to each other as you simply would on Windows PCs and Chromebooks."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"The image, sound and speed is great. This was a gift for my daughter. She started using it tiday so do not know about battery life yet.She is really happy."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"Battery life was wonderful. However, multiple issues with interacting with Zoom; which was a central reason for purchasing the MacBook. I have an Apple phone and thought a MacBook would be a great addition. Unfortunately, that was not  the case for me. If you aren’t familiar with MacBooks, it takes some adjusting to go from a laptop to a MacBook. I ended up returning the MacBook and purchased a laptop instead."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,best seller and good product
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,Have been wanting one for a while great purchase and the m1 chip is well worth it
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,I never thought I would be saying an Apple product is best value for the money. This laptop does everything we need and more!

Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"I ordered the gold Mac, and dressed it up nicely. This is by far the fastest computer I ever owned. There’s absolutely no delay in any program you run."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"Very lightweight. Super fast.I only dislike that I have to buy apps that are free on my phone, but this is a great PC for what I need"
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"I LOVEEEE IT ❤️ It’a everything I wanted, it works beautifully and it came fast and safe worth every penny !!"
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"Great screen, surprisingly amazing speakers, unparalleled speed and battery life."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,This was a value replacement for my 12 year old MacBook Pro. The Touch ID pad makes my life easier.
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,Now that I am working at home part-time decided to upgrade my office. Very happy with this monitor - bought 2 and have them side by side.
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,It’s perfect. I wish I had got AppleCare as I thought I had ordered. But I said it up it’s fine.

Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,Came on time and without a scratch. Save money and buy from here
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"It’s a very good laptop I like it, too bad is not touchScreen and I wanted like that."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"To hard to set up and use. Not real computer literate, old man. Always used android computers. First MacBook and at this point would not buy again.  Have iPhone, iPad, and I something for music. Those are easy to use. Not the MacBook. Bought brand new, won’t buy a MacBook next time. Haven’t used it once since I got it. Heard they were so much better than androids. Don’t think so."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,No complains so far.  Very fast and performs great.  I had a 2014 MacBook Air and finally upgraded this year.  This is leagues beyond that entry and I’m very happy with this upgrade.
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,I love it! It was everything I asked for! It came on time and it was amazing! It was delivered with care and everything works amazingly great!
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,The M1 is so fast. And I really like that they changed to keyboard on this model. They are raised more so I can actually feel when I'm pressing on them.
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,the only issue is that Ican not use more than 5 safari windowsopen at a time with no other apps openafter that any more applications cause extreme slow down
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"Only issue I have is the front camera Is not clear, I needed to buy a webcam"
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"Still learning how to use it, but for college the laptop is amazing."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,Not sure what happened. But it came with a dent on screen. But still works great.

Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"Front facing camera is only 720p, but everything else is perfect. Rose gold matches her Apple Watch, and made for an excellent follow up gift from last years Valentine."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,Laptop worked for a couple of days and then promptly failed. Battery completely died (stopped holding charge) and power supply also failed! I had to go to an Apple store to power it back up and wipe it out to return it. Worst thing about this experience is the return policy; my only option is UPS pickup. I have been staying home all day for 4 days but UPS has not shown up. Amazon support is also a joke.
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,Todo bien.  Se la compre a mi hija para uso en la Universidad.
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"""It is an amazing work of art created for longevity usage and fashioned for designed purpose""."

Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,I don’t do gaming
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,It was time...my 2015 laptop was showing some signs of wear and out-dating. It didn't take much adjustment to upgrade my brain. ;-)

Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,Solid product and a good value.
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,Had to take computer to Apple care center because after spending 3 hours in the phone with Apple support they couldn’t help me anymore.

Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,Very fast computer.  Lots pf fun for a first time Apple user.

Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"I purchased this for my wife figuring that professionals are fine working with 13-inch MacBook Pros and she only needed the Air, base package, which we received in such a tiny box that we didn't dare open it up because it was so incredibly tiny that whatever was inside had to be minuscule and our older, more experienced, tired eyes could not have dealt with such a toy. I sent it back unopened today. Still not sure there was a MacBook Air in there, it was so miniature in size."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,Everything I expected and more.

Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,Es el mejor computador que he tenido en mi vida. Superó todas las expectativas
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"The laptop was just as if I bought it from Apple myself, only it was cheaper AND in the color I wanted!"
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,I love this laptop!
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"I love it , for the price point it’s a steal! Absolutely worth it"
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,I've been using Apple MacBook Pros for years.  I thought I'd try an Air.  Very happy with it!
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"I wanted to download shows from Netflix, etc. and use this on a plane without wifi, but Apple makes it impossible and really pushes you toward Apple TV. Don't buy this if you plan to use it for a similar purpose."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"love this product!  Set up was super fast and easy for this modern elder, and love the integration with my other apple devices!"
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,Great laptop..helps a Windows user like me adapt to the Apple ecosystem.  Just needs 1080p camera
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,It did everything by old aMacpro did and it was easy to convert to the few new things that were added plusses
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"Looked forward to this new MacBook Air.  Loved the Magic Keyboard, but everything else seems half-baked Apple.I didn't know enough to immerse myself in the (hard-to-find)  Essentials Manual before touching the FORCE touchpad.  Took a long time that to realize that ""force""  really meant FORCE (as in ""smash it down"" )  There is a System Preferences bypass, but I got embroiled in a DARK MODE display (black screen), missing cursor, and of course loss of Intel-chip based favorite apps which all took precedence over trying to find and read a possible Manual.  Help menu did not help..I tried, I really did.  Apple Support suggested and helped for 2 days, with hours spent trying over & over to erase, then Reinstall Big Sur  software, but 2 hours loading (for each of dozens of tries), then ""An error occurred preparing this update.  Please try again.""was too much, over and over.  This software is not ready for primetime.  Looking forward to AIR's next iteration.Meanwhile, I must be content with my older MacBook Pro, while MacBoo Air is returned:  ""rest in peace""."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"If you're in the market for a new laptop, I can't recommend this computer highly enough. Excellent computer. No complaints. Love it. Five stars."

Returning since most of my work is giving video presentations.Update: the camera somehow got better after a few days of use, I have no idea what happened. But a month of having this, it's getting glitchy. The processing speed is not the same and has a lot of lags."

Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,Everything I wanted in a laptop and more
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,Is very fast and reliable
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"UPDATE: the battery is not dead - the motherboard is.The computer worked fine for 14 months and then the battery died. Wouldn't charge, wouldn't hold a charge while plugged in. I took it to the Apple store where they told me it would be $428 to fix the problem (I bought a replacement Microsoft laptop for less than that). They wanted me to complain to Amazon for selling me a dud when I was talking to them about fixing it. Bad customer service, don't stand behind their product, and I won't be buying a Mac again as it just turned out to be a $1000 paperweight."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"I was so excited to buy my first MacBook.  Opened the first one and nothing zip, zero, dead. Charged it, called Apple, who told me to return it.  It took over an hour to get Amazon to accept the return and ship me a replacement.  Next morning get MacBook number 2- super excited because I open it and it comes on and sings a song! Loved it for the 3 hours it worked.  It updated and Locked me out.  Did everything they told me to do online, call Apple that admits they are having this issue and I can return it for another one! Since it’s not 14 days old.  No thanks.  I am done.  Since Apple told me to return it this time Amazon was amazing and is picking it up for return tomorrow.  This was a crappy experience.  I love my iPad Pro and iPhones- no more MacBook for me."

Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"Im sure its amazing for die hard Mac users. However, the one port is a non starter for me. I opened it started it up and one I realized I had to buy accessories to add anything additional, I cleaned it and packed back up to return. One port is horribly inconvenient for my needs, and having to carry around an accessory to add even one more is a waste of my energy. I can and will purchase something more adaptable and suited to my needs"
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"Absolutely love, love, love my laptop!!!"
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,Love it
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,Fastest computer I’ve ever had.
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,It’s perfect. As you’d expect.
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,Feels very impressive to own
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,The best
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,Nothing wrong with the MacBook itself. It was just not practical for me what I needed for my work. So I started a return. First you send them the product I guess in good faith. Then once they receive the item then with in 7 days they will refund your purchase. Mind you I returned this in the complete original package only 4 days after receiving it. It’s going on 2 months and nothing but Crickets from everyone. Buyer Beware!!
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,Simply the best!
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,Love my MacBook
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,Product smelled like it was stored in a warehouse that was moist and musty. I’m glad I bought the extended warranty.

Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"The camera is so poor that I have to drag an old Logitech 720. The Defeats  my reason for buying a very small laptop to do Zoom meetings when I need to take the Logitech off my Dell. You are in the graphics business. I bought a iPhone 13 Max Pro as well. Everything else is beautiful!,"

Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,Did not use it.
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,Excelente Producto
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,Super genial cumple todas las expectativas
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,Exactly what I needed.
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"I bought my computer in Feb 2021. Now it is April 2022 and it shuts itself off without warning, with a defective pink screen. I'd be surprised if it lasts throughout the month. I'm not sure if this is due to planned obsolescence, or some other reason. Either way, I am not impressed. One year is not a good shelf life for a computer. My previous MacBook lasted only 2 years before it shut itself down for good. My older MacBook Pro from 2012 still works, so I know that it is not me that is the problem."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,You'll not find a better Mac!
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"Liked performance, battery life, fan-less design"
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,Excelente producto
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"I just got my new laptop less than a month ago... I picked it up by the screen, and im a pretty tiny person.. and it like broke on the inside or something, the screen just shot out.. i wanted to just replace it for a new one But i would have had to go to the bank to put money in, because i guess you need the amount it would cost to do that. I was told that we would just do the refund, and i could rebuy it.. my refund seems to be taking a while, and it looks like the prices just went up on top of it. So im not very happy right now. i want to get the replacement. Def going to get the apple care plan (which also looks like it went up in price)  from like 2 days ago"
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,No usb port for microhone use

Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,excelente lo habia soñado. contento con mi mac
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"Unfortunately I bought this laptop new, brand new in box, then after editing large files for photography, I noticed I had no storage very quickly. Starting cleaning the laptop up and realized it was used.  Found a couple who had a few video files of their trip to Mexico. Several other files I had never seen before and had my tech guy at work clean it up and he could tell right away it was used. Really disappointing I paid for the NEW versus the used and still got a used laptop.  It works great but still fraudulent. Just be careful ordering these off of amazon."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,I loovvvee it 🥺

Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,Couldn’t use my usb had to buy a connector. Doesn’t connect to my canon printer - not compatible. Amazon sold me a windows office package for it was supposed to work. Not compatible. Bought a care package for support and problems. -no number to call. Not worth the money.
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,Lovely. Just amazing.
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"This is a Mac.  I like the products, but this little Mac could not do what I needed.  I returned the product, it has been received at the warehouse but my money is still not returned.  I the computer for 2 days and then Insent back.  Please refund my money."

Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,Amazing
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"I had my mac for one day before it quit working—it was installed with Big Sur, which has a bug in it causing the trackpad to malfunction. No trackpad = no way of using your laptop (especially because it won’t recognize an external mouse with this bug. I paid over a thousand dollars to have a computer for a single day. While it worked, the speed was great and the screen crystal clear, but both of those are pointless without a way to use the computer. I’m doing the 3-hour software update now to (hopefully) fix the problem, but I highly recommend purchasing a different computer."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,Good Mac! Nice...
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"Bought 2 ipads, could not connect to internet, wasted money.  Bought an expensive phone, needed assembly, never worked, wasted money.  Bought a new MacBook, in setup after argument to use English, when I entered the Wi-Fi password 3 times, it never accepted it, it went nuts and sailed off into disability screens I could not fathom.  The touchpad seems not to work.  Does not have a USB port, without using an external mouse is less than junk to me.  Now we start pulling teeth, scheduled a return, will I get credit?RUN FROM APPLE PRODUCTS ! ! !"
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,Original
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,Es muy buena
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,Super fast and cool
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"The macbook air M1 arrived totally dead with no charging cable or power brick.  The laptop was extremely beat up, scratched everywhere and completely grimy and dirty.  It looks like it was never cleaned.  The hinge also has wear and the lid does not want to stay up.  an utter and complete piece of crap."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"Had to replace the screen with warranty, it came with burned pixels. Other than that, good laptop"
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,Amazing
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,Best laptop
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,Excelente
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"Don’t appreciate how I received a used macbook with fingerprints on the screen. They tried to put the film back on the screen as it was originally, but it wasn’t stuck to the screen as it should have been. I returned it because i refuse to spend that much money on something someone else had their hands one. It’s unacceptable especially due to covid. I went and bought one locally and it was brand new no fingerprints and the film was stuck to the screen as it should be because thats how Apple packages it."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"This machine is NOT powerful enough to run design software and Google Chrome at the same time. Just FYI. It's laggy, sputters, and a total piece of junk for the most part if you're trying to run any of Adobe Suite or Sketchup or heavy'ish program. It has trouble runing Keynote, Spotify, and chrome at the same time. This is great for surfing the web and using a few of the internal apple products but a complete waste of money if you're looking for a work computer and do any kind of creative design or work. Apple's products are garbage and we're all stuck in their hellish ecosphere."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,Super fast
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,Perfecto!!
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,Great laptop.
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,Waiting for credit from Amazon on return via UPS. We were unable to have this laptop work with Zoom no audio or video and it was unstable with the Google Chrome browser. My son is a software engineer for a San Francisco Social media company and he thinks that this new processing chip being used by Apple is problematic.
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,Good
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"Shockingly substandard quality. It's very, very slow to respond. For THAT reason alone, it's getting returned, not because the box it came in smells musty like it's been sitting in a wet basement for years."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,Shuts down randomly constantly needs repairs
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,Wonderful
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,It didn’t function properly I returned it UPS picked it up it’s been 45 days and I still don’t have a refund or information
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,Impossible to use the camera. Had to purchase and external camera.
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,Back in 2020 I put the laptop on once. Tried to set it up and then shut it off since I couldn’t do it. Tried to turn it back it on in 2022 and it would not charge. Bought a battery from Apple and it still won’t turn in ! Such a waste of money for something I can’t even use.
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,I purchased the MacBook Air assuming the computer was new because the item said “new”.  After a week of owning the computer and charging once. I decided to look at the battery cycle count and it read “14”.  Meaning it had been charged 14 times at full cycle.  I contacted Apple and they said testing involves 1-3 cycles.  I suspect it was already used heavily for a month.  So I returned it.  Very hesitant to purchase a laptop again from Amazon.
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,Got this laptop for work and less than a year later I've had to service it twice. TRASH!!!!
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"Must have gotten a damaged unit. Trouble connecting to WiFi, arrows had to be punched several times to work, Netflix “error” codes came up during streaming, stopping viewing until dealt with. Got an IPad Pro, which is wonderful:} Amazon great about return and refund. Thanks, Amazon! William B."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,Their support staff created more problems than I could ever have and i have wasted at least 20 hours on hold and trying to get Apple to set up my new MAC and I still cannot use this computer.  I am seriously thinking to send back and hoping I can!
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,I assumed it would operate like my I pad.  Takes forever for screen to respond when I click on something. It is not user friendly.  Waste of my money.  I wish I had returned it
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,I spent more than six hours on the phone with Apple support trying to get this to work. Total fail and waste of time. I never thought I’d buy an apple product that was defective.
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,honestly this laptop is garbage!!!! I HAD a macbookpro from 2013 that was almost neck on photoshop and illustrator being almost 10 years old ! like cumoon ! … oh and u have to buy a dam dongle because it only comes with 2 usbc connections and u know dam welll one is for charging ! … also if u dont have another mac dont eveer open disk utility because u need a secoond one if u erase ur hardrive
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"The media could not be loaded.
                



 Good evening. I purchased a brand new computer in March with the hope that i would be using a system trouble free. To my surprize not many days after... i notice the screen start flickering. I would would like this to be attended to ASAP as this is the only gadget for school work."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,It’s very nice but isn’t what I need
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,I never write reviews but I’m taking time to write this one.tried to save some money on a open box Mac never again with Amazon they have horrible quality control could not even get through setup without it freezing up and then it does not recognize my Apple ID returning and going to bestbuy would of reordered with Amazon but have to wait till return is received and then then they will mail one out that’s going to take maybe two weeks total time I don’t think so never again
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"This ""USER GUIDE"" does not guide and is of little use.  It appears to me as if the author threw together some thoughts or previous documents with little concern with order or the reader's needs."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,3 hours with apple support  - with no relief in sight - no way to turn off favorites side which pops up when ever it wants - need an additional lap top will not purchase this again

 I only had this MacBook for two days and the screen started to peel off. there's no screen protector or any other film covering the screen. I noticed there was a bubble on the top right corner and it started to peel off, revealing a white screen."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"Will NOT support Apple's 2011 THunderbolt 27"" Display. I have spent hundreds of dollars on connectors/converters and dongles which do not work. Both Apple and Amazon have sent me around 10 items that DO NOT WORK. I have a tremor which makes it hard to work on a small screen.  I was informed that each of the solutions would work by both companies and other third-party sellers to whom they have directed me.  SHAME ON THEM! Apple is not my friend."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,The mouse is moving alone and changing the page by itself.
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,Loving it so far. Wish I could afford a bigger screen but nice to be able to finally afford a new Mac after 13 years. I still find Microsoft office tools easier to use esp snipping tool I’m finding Macs version of this frustrating and confusing and not as simple but it’s still a Mac so whatever
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,No instructions what to do when something is not working. I can not connect to the blue tooth and the apple stores are closed in my town. I don’t know how to fix it
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"This would have been great, the computer is epic.  But why do you default to gold?  I bought this under a timeline to bring overseas and they sent me a gold version, like who wants that? I returned it and it's been over two weeks and haven't gotten any refund, so it's just been a whole mess that could have been avoided.  Stop defaulting to a color no-one wants.  Rant over."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"The unit is smaller than the original Air, also it has NO USB ports, the description on the page is misleading and they never show the right-hand side of the unit in the pictures, otherwise, I would have never bought it, Amazon return policy is horrible they take 2 weeks to refund your money, took it out looked at it said nope, didn't even registered it.  Waste of time and money."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,ordered a new macbook came used everything is a scam how now to return the money?
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,After 2 months their is a error that I can’t turn my videos at all. I watch YouTube to fix it but didn’t work. I am pretty upset and not happy.
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,Se supone que compré un artículo nuevo y a un mes de la compra solo no enciende.
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,I really haven't used this as of yet.  All the Macs I have had in the past except one were A quality in all respects
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"Item was delivered dented, I’m not sure if it was the manufacture or delivery company but I definitely am not happy."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,I loved my computer and the affirm payment plan. My husband had me purchase as my Christmas gift. I have had it less then 3 months but over the Amazon exchange time and it's a paper weight because the keyboard no longer works. Cautious is all I can say when buying electronics of expense from Amazon.
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"I purchased for my son to use for school, it stopped working after two weeks, I spent the past two weeks working with Apple who can't get it to function.  I contacted Amazon to replace, they have refused to replace and continue to re-direct me to Apple.  Don't buy an Apple computer from Amazon, they will not replace it even if defective."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"Very disappointing. Those 2 USB c ports as the only ports, is the most disappointing thing ever. Also, it runs out of memory quite often. I only stick with it because of a software I need. Otherwise, I stick to my windows laptop and stay sane"
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"I bought this just to try Apple and I absolutely hate it the layout, no touch screen, keys are hard to type on bc super small and the worst is trying to return it. Return option is only 1 and its been such a hassle to even return it and you get charged"
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"I had several problems so took the MacBook Air into Best Buy for help.  I was told I had received ""a lemon"" and should return it to Amazon.  I had it 3 weeks so was able to return it for a refund which I am waiting for right now.  I have loved my 2012 MacBook Air and am hoping the next one I order will be okay."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"I think you would have a hard time finding a Windows laptop that did not support 2 external monitors.  Yet, this laptop, more advanced in every other way than pretty much any Windows laptop in its price range, only supports a single external monitor.  I would never have even thought to ask the question.  Absolutely unacceptable."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,Quut working within a week from purchasing. Screen would freeze up and flicker. Screen eventually went black and would reset itself causing loss if previous work.
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,Not compatible with protoos  it says it is but its not.
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,HorribleIt would not let me sign in and or change passwordHorrible to the bone a nothing
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,This piece of junk is unable to connect wirelessly to  my printer.  My 10 year old mac has no problems printing on my Epson printer.  I have tried everything suggested and it still claims my printer is OFFLINE.It won't even find the printer when it is connected to it with a USB cable.  I think Apple has really screwed this product up.
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"I returned it because it wasn’t what I was looking for, therefore I cans rate it!"
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,I love my IPad so I thought this would be great but it is not. No touch screen. I am having trouble even using it. Total waste of my money.
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,Very bad contrast. Very bad video resolution.
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"Computer came on time, was in the original box, even though the box was scratched up. not a issue, you can see it in the pic. came with a new charger, and charging block, battery health is at 100%, which is a plus. amazing purchase came in the color i ordered as well."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,This is my first MacBook and it's perfect entry laptop into the Apple brand.  I don't need it for a ton of applications so the MacBook Air is perfect for me.  I'm able to access all of my needed applications.  Easy transition from traditional laptop.  It is a little different with shortcuts from what I was use to but I've adapted quickly.  This laptop is lightweight and easy to use!
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"So I am by no means a super heavy tech guy, but I was wanting a new laptop for when I go back to school, movie streaming, etc and I can say with confidence that this is the best laptop I have ever used, owned, typed on, you name it. I love how small, compact and portable the laptop is while still being able to pack the punch it is advertised to bring. I love the feel of the keyboard and feel like I am able to type lightning fast on it. I really have nothing bad to say about this laptop. Unless you are a heavy computer gamer I think this laptop is perfect for everybody. Make sure you look around because I was actually able to get this laptop from BestBuy for $799.99 brand new so I was able to get this laptop for a great price! Amazon at the time had it for the same price but I did not want to risk damage from shipping."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,Best laptop on earth..great battery perfect design and unbelievably performant.
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"I use my MacBook Air M1 equally docked and undocked. At home I can connect to up to three monitors with the help of a powered docking station and Display Link. When I purchased this one that I've had for about a year or so I was also issued an upgrade for my work Mac, a Pro that was also an M1 and fully loaded. The pro was thicker and a fair amount heavier so hauling both sucked sometimes.I'm sure some heavy dev's, gamers or power photoshop users that need a remote workstation away from their Mac Pro (or Mac Studio) a MacBook Pro may be a better options but that comes with the negative of a bigger form factor, bigger and heavier power adapter and a bit more cost.I think this is a great fit for knowledge workers, it blows my new Lenovo Win laptop for work out of the water) and still handles large card imports from my SLR and Mirrorless cameras like a champ. I'm really not seeing unacceptable delays in Light Room and only use PhotoShop on targeted issues rarely.This and a pair of Mac Pro noise canceling headphones were the two best Apple products I've bought in the last year and a half or so."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,I don’t like this very much I Kant get the app that I need and like
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"I think this laptop is overrated. Reviews say it does not get hot but with only 10 minutes of playing some games, it went super hot that i had to turn it off. The M1 processor which they say is powerful did not live up to all the hype. No wonder it's cheaper than dell xps 13."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,I’ve had this for a few months and the SCREEN turning black with lines. Can’t fix it. Keeps glitching and it’s bad performance for the price absolutely not worth it. It’s all just aesthetically pleasing that’s it nothing more. Save yourself some money.
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,If your clumsy get a better laptop
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,It stopped working after 10 months 😞I just don’t understand how in less than a year my computer screen goes black. This computer never fell so I want to speak with a customer service representatives.
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,One of the speakers and the camera stopped working after a few months.
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,DO NOT BUY. This computer has had issues from day 1. I’ve had to go to the Mac store 3 times now and I’m going again on Monday. It’s always a new issue. USELESS!!!!!!!
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"What's not to like. I bought the M1 Macbook Air just in case Apple decided to discontinue it even though my old Mackbook Pros (2012 and 2015) continue to work just fine. Decided to get in in gold for a little something different. Performs great and Migration Assistant copied everything over perfectly. Oh, and the price around $800 was terrific."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,My first Apple product. So far finding it difficult to set up. No instructions. Not intuitive at all. All my android were much easier to use right out of the box. Still trying to figure out how to load a program. Grrr
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,Only 8gb ram. The most this thing can do is watch YouTube and send emails
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,Mousepad is defective
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"I PURCHASED A NEW MacBook Air, AND I RECEIVED A USED ONE WITH SOFTWARE ALREADY IN INSTALLED BY SOMEONE IN THE UK. THE CURSER WOULD STICK AND THE COMPUTER WOULD SHUT DOWN, TERRIBLE FOR A PRICE OF OVER $900."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"PC and MAC user since 80's.  While I've had to upgrade my Intel PC's multiple times each decade, the MAC keeps on plugging.  Get 10 years out of the MAC easy.  Then when you think they are done, load them up with UNBUTU or other Linux OS and get few more years out of them.The M1 Macbook Air is exceptionally fast compared to my 2017 Intel IMAC.  Added a lightning hub so I can access my external devices to store data I don't want on cloud.2nd M1 Macbook Air after getting one for kids school after Chromebook pandemic mediocrity and using an M1 MAC MINI for year.  PC has stopped doing what I need ot do easily and is too tied to MS.  I can access all my legacy MS files with the Macbook air without being tied to MS subscription!  They work and work well."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"Ive had this since one since it came out and the screen just magically broke yesterday, do better apple. My dell has lasted almost 5 years now"
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"The MacBook Air is convenient like every other computer used daily and is compactible due to size. It goes for the high price of thirteen hundred dollars with very little features besides its editing equipment. The computer’s processing chip isn’t the best on the market, which makes the computer work slow a while after using. It’s a simple use for a computer with very little storage, but it keeps things organized and easy to find. Sometimes files tend to glitch out of the memory causing me to redo a few assignments. The screen has a clear picture, which makes it better when having to read and do homework. The computer itself is very clean and simple to use but doesn’t come with feature that most high-priced computer have.  After paying a heavy amount on a computer the features it has is limited compared to buying an iPad for the same price."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,Lasted 1 year and a half and had to pay $692 to replace the logic board. I would buy a laptop with an M1 to avoid overheating
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"Jumping from a 2013, MacBook Pro 15 inch with 16 GB RAM and 1TB SSDWas very surprised to see the Geekbench score was more than double on this device , but guess I shouldn't be with how exponentially and fast technology advances!!Super speedy for my daily usage and battery life is insane.Definitely can't complain!I opted for the Gold color, but kind of wish I went for the space gray because it looks more pinkish/copper than gold"
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,Screen broke just a week outside of one year. Warranty. It’s a $500 repair. This is insane.
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,Opened my brand new $1000++ computer and the entire screen was cracked and destroyed. Awesome! Thanks Amazon.
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,I loved this computer until I tried to use the USB port. IT DOES NOT HAVE ONE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"For sure a 10/10, great quality, great product. Packing was done very nice and the product is holding up nicely. I would spend the extra money to buy a carrying case and screen protector to protect your investment!"
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"Nice price bt pack had toxic black mold. Not returning bc I couldn't smell anything on the hardware itself and I have stuff that needs to get done. Advise looking somewhere other than Amazon. ""If it looks too good to be true, it probably is"" Very disappointed."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"battery is not good , a lot of time to rechange , No buy again , I saw very good review from this seller then bye , but be carful it is not refundable"
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"I don’t really like it, I can’t download iTunes whenever I want to download iTunes it’s just too difficult and every time this message (iTunes quit  unsuspectedly) appears every time I download it, I can’t download it and I really need it to fix my iPhone."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"I was able to snag one of these for $700 with the M2 MacBook Air arriving the day after I am writing this review. If it was in this price bracket all the time, it would be a no brainer best choice, and I am having a hard time finding worthy competition even at its $1,000 msrp range.What it does well:Trackpad-  The trackpad on the MacBook Air is unbelievable. Using pressure sensitivity to simulate clicks on a piece of glass, the MacBook lineup puts all other laptop manufacturers on notice. This is a best in class experience.Keyboard-  Say what you will about laptop keyboards but this is a phenomenal typing experience. The only type of keyboard I would rather be using is a mechanical keyboard, but in this form factor, it is as good as it gets. The only complaints I have are that the arrow keys are really small.Display-  The display provides a fantastic viewing experience. I thought this is where the laptop would fall behind its more expensive counterparts with OLED and Mini LED displays, but the color accuracy, respectable 400 nit peak brightness, and 2560 x 1600 resolution are leaps better than anything I have experienced on an HP or Lenovo device. I wish the display was slightly bigger, but do not mind using it at all. This is a very good display for the money.Build Quality-  Apple just continues to excel at building things.Speakers-  Solid speakers with exceptional clarity, volume, and bass. Better than anything I have owned before it.What it does bad:Gaming-  Do not buy this laptop with the hopes that you can game on it. Most games I thought of installing were not available on Mac OS. It is in this category that Windows dominates the market.IO-  You get 2 USB C ports and a headphone jack. This fits my lifestyle just fine, but I cannot speak for everyone. It is up to you to determine whether you can live without USB A, HDMI out, or SD Readers built in.Base Hardware-  At this price point, 256gb is not enough. 512 should be the standard, not a $160 add on."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,$900 later and the sceeen quit on me. Don’t think I’ll be buying another computer from Amazon.
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,The computer kept freezing up
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,Came broken still no refund 6 months
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"Screen flickers at random and laptop crashes, lesson learned, amazon warehouse electronics are crap, had a very bad experience with other amazon warehouse buying.Laptop is good when it works, opens up fast, but I just ended up with a dud"
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,I purchased a new version and I was sent a refurbished one.I found that it was refurbished when I tried adding apps to the laptop.A pop up came on the screen stating certain apps are not compatible with jail broken laptops.
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,Do not buy this I got this and put it on the charger for no more than 30 minutes and i go back into my room and it’s literally on fire. It almost burned my house down
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,This laptop is not compatible with anything. If you are a DELL user you will HATE it.You have to purchase a docking station or you won't have enough ports. You can't save word docs to your desktop.  The only positive is the battery life.
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,This expensive laptop has no CD drive or USB drive. What the heck. What a dumb expensive computer. Even my ten year old laptops are better than this.
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"i cant image how come apple will put such a low resolution camera on a 1000 laptop. i bought it mainly for zoom meeting but it's not to my expectation, so i returned it"
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,my new 13in Macbook Air has a lot of fingerprints on the INSIDE of the glass screen. It's on the top left corner down the left side and starts along the bottom. I don't like it .
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"I love my Macbook Air. It is fast, thin, and affordable. With OS Ventura it is just perfect."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"The battery only lasts a few hours before it is dead, despite being used for menial tasks that do not typically drain a battery much. Not at all what I was expecting based on their marketing."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"I read the comments and it seemed legit but when I received my package, I didn’t get a MacBook. I got a broken HP with no charger!!! Now I have to wait forever for my refund"
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,Ever since I bought my laptop I have glitches on my computer. I haven’t been able to use touch screen. Glitching makes it not possible to game
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,Computer was not able to charge are a monthe or so. Took to Apple reps stated could not help me that day because Amazon is a 3rd vendor.
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,neither me or my brilliant techie friends could make it even to the third screen of demands without becoming locked out.  Back to PCs .
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"I received my Apple Macbook Air in May of 2021.  It died February 19, 2022."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,apparently it did not arrive as I expected 😔 it was a failure 😫
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"OMG! This is such an incredible product. Perfect keyboard, perfect weight, perfect battery life, perfect trackpad, perfect performance, perfect Touch ID, perfect feel, perfect build, perfect look, perfect size, perfect stereo sound, perfect screen, perfect noise absence as not having a fan! I mean, it doesn't have a fan and it doesn't get hot most of the times. WTF?! It's the only laptop I've been able to use in my bed for x amount of hours and it is sooo comfortable to do it. It truly is one of the best products out there and it is totally worth the investment, because that's how I see it, not even as spending, that's just how good it is. I'm enthusiastic because this is for sure the best device Apple has created in terms of price/what you get, and it will probably stay in that position for a couple of years. This is game-changing and revolutionary. The computer feels as if it will last 10+ years, honestly. I highly recommend it. BTW, it is so good my girlfriend decided to get one for herself because she just couldn't get over the first time she used it, and just how beautiful it is and pleasurable to look at from any perspective... This laptop is so ridiculously perfect that you can even open it with one hand and in just a couple of seconds, you will be ready to use it as it has an always-on feature that allows you to get down to the working right away. That is probably the best feat. True Tone is also really good, as it is automatic brightness adjustment and dark mode, they sit together perfectly well. Get it! You won't regret it at any moment. Truly a high-end experience. Oh, and... It looks elegant at any angle, and which is most important, classy it feels."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,much worse build quality than older mac airs
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"Purchase warranty, im having issuers with screen and it restarts my laptop. Return policy is only for 30 days. Not worth issues. wish I could of purchased from another vendor."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,Excelent product
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,This computer was not able to be set up and had an inherent problem. We had to send back for full refund.
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,Worst computer I’ve used. Screen dead after one month. Battery isn’t lasting long. Freezes and input output very slow.
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"The 2020 MacBook Air BigSur OS is one of the newest computers on the market at the moment and one of Apple’s best designs. Apple has had many MacBook models throughout their many years of being the best electronic company, but The BigSur OS has many features that other models and other company computers do not have. This MacBook comes with high quality upload speed, all-day battery life, and superfast memory, which makes it the best choice for any computer or laptop right now. For a student and any other user, upload speed is definitely one of the most important qualities on a computer. This MacBook’s upload speed is fast enough that it can be considered a gaming laptop also. It has an Apple M1 Chip with an eight-core CPU which delivers up to almost four times as fast as past generations. This M1 Chip is designed by Apple designers themselves which other companies do not have access to. This BigSur is the quickest computer on the computer and laptop market which puts Apple as the highest revenue electronic company. Battery-life is another quality that is essential to many people, especially a student in the year 2021. Many universities and high schools have switched to using mainly online tests, textbooks, notes, and activities. All day battery-life is important because some students are using their computer up to nine hours a day with school, homework, and studying for tests and quizzes. This MacBook uses lithium polymer batteries which provide up to 18 hours of battery life. These batteries also are good for the environment and conservation. These are the best batteries for computers because they provide the best life and are good for the environment. Good memory and lots of storage are also crucial qualities of a computer. This MacBook can be used for up to ten years if there are not any software problems. This MacBook has eight GB of unified memory that makes everything you do have fast upload speed and responsiveness. Having enough memory and storage is great. For example, a student or a teacher would need to save documents, projects, notes and many more things. If there is not enough storage to do those things that a student needs to do then things will end up lost and not recovered. A lot of storage is also needed for a gamer because there needs to be space to download the games and have room for any spontaneous updates that might occur. Good memory and storage are important to many people and that's what makes the BigSur OS the best computer on the market. The MacBook BigSur has many pros that other computers just do not have and is a reasonable price for all the features it comes with. This model is an amazing choice for students, teachers, gamers, engineers, IT workers, and anyone who uses their computer a lot. The MacBook BigSur OS definitely continues to be one of the top rated computers and gives users a big bang for their buck."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,Fraud.
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,M1 chipset does not support two monitors. Not sure why Apple would do this! And won’t except returns after 14 days.
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,This is a very good laptop and easy to use.  A few things I've noticed is the backlit keyboard is very nice and adjusts automatically.  The keyboard is easy to type on and get used to and the touchpad is great.  The battery is extremely good too.I also use Apple Music and was pleased to find that spacial audio (Dolby Atmos) music songs played back on the Airs speakers and sounds amazing compared to high res stereo tracks.It's these little things I've found out about while using this computer that just amazes me all the time after just two weeks of ownership.  I would have bought it at Amazon but I could pick it up at my local BestBuy for 899 dollars when I got it.
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,Not even a year old and it died on me.
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"Through the past year and a half, students have had to use personal computers and laptops for everyday tasks, most importantly being school. From my personal experience I believe that the MacBook Air 2020 is the best tool for the job. If you plan to frequently use a personal computer or laptop in the future, the MacBook Air is the right choice because of its processing speed and storage, ability to keep a charge, and the apple compatibility that it uses.First, the MacBook Air 2020 is amazingly convenient to use throughout the day because of its ability to hold a charge and how quickly it gets charged. In my school days I did not have very much time to worry about the battery life of my computer. Now I do not have to do that at all because I only need to charge my computer once to twice a week and its 30 hour charge. Next, the apple compatibility that it uses, including Apple music, iMessage, Facetime, etc., makes this product very easy to use while not having to use multiple devices to do actions such as getting a photo from your photos or getting that one picture from a text. This apple compatibility lets you see all of these things and not have to worry about changing devices to do so. Finally, is the processing speed and storage. The MacBook Air 2020 has a processor that is considered to be great for gaming and running large applications within the computer. This makes the computer amazingly fast while doing average school work and using it for everyday life. Although it is expensive, the MacBook Air has been considered to be the best for its price out of all of the MacBooks, including computers such as the MacBook Pro. The strange thing that the MacBook has is amazing showing its slim appearance and lightweight feel. The storage that is available with the MacBook is 256GB, 512GB, 1TB, or 2TB, but most went with 512GB. These large amounts of storage are fantastic, showing that one of the MacBook Air's biggest competitors(Dell XPS 13) only lets you choose between 128GB and 256GB. Now if you want to have a large amount of pictures or apps on your computer that kind of storage just won't cut it. For these reasons the MacBook Air 2020 is the best choice for daily use and school work because of its processing speed and storage, ability to keep a charge, and the apple compatibility.Overall, the MackBook Air has the processing speed, storage capacity, battery life, and the apple compatibility to make it the best choice for a laptop or personal computer. Throughout the last year and a half, I have had to be on my computer a lot to do school work and many other things. Getting this computer has not only helped me do this quicker, but has improved the quality of my work because of its nice layout and convenience."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"This is the best laptop I’ve ever owned for a few reasons.SPEEDIt’s lightning fast. The M1 chip almost never struggles, opening apps and web pages in seconds.SCREENThe screen is very high resolution with little glare. There’s NO TOUCHSCREEN, but I didn’t even notice until I’d owned it for a month cause I don’t use that.BUILD QUALITYIt’s sturdy, light, and durable. It’s powder coated so it doesn’t scratch easily, but when it’s not pretty.macOSThe operating system is great on its own, but with an iPhone it’s incredible. Messages, photos, websites, and mail from your phone just appear on your laptop.I don’t know if another laptop that hits all these points for under $1000.Now as for the cons…Not enough storage - 256gb is not enough. You can get by if all you do is browse the web and use Microsoft word, but for anything beyond that you’ll need AT LEAST 512gb.Gaming - macOS has a very small selection of gaming options. It’s not a gaming machine, but it’s laughably small.For the games it does have, the fps and speed is reasonable. It’s not incredible, but like I said it’s not a gaming machine."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"Macbook Review Apple has created many technological wonders throughout the time of the business, and the Mac is no exception. I have had different laptops before highschool, like Chromebooks, so I knew what I liked and did not like. After about two months of searching, I landed on the Macbook.  When researching which laptop to buy for highschool, I landed upon the Macbook for its reliable battery, the great software, and the modern features brought by the Macbook, like touch I.D. and Siri. The modern aspects of the Macbook are beyond great, and serve many purposes that other laptops fail to incorporate. The first one is fingerprint recognition. When I had old laptops, I always had to remember every character of the password, and it was just a plain hassle. Now, however, Apple has a fingerprint scanner built into the computer itself, which I find extremely useful. Between my school passwords, my home passwords, and other important information, that is a lot to keep track of. Now, though, all I need is my fingerprint and I can get into all of my accounts with my fingerprint. Also, the Macbook comes with Siri, a virtual assistant to do tasks and find different files on the Mac. There are many different papers, files, and websites needed to keep track of, and finding all those efficiently is almost impossible on your own. But, Siri makes it easier. To activate Siri, all you have to do is simply say “Hey, Siri” and the assistant will appear. Siri responds to what is said, so if I say, “Hey Siri, find ‘Review 2’ from Google Drive,” the document will appear seconds later. Although the modern technologies of the Macbook are important, just as important is the software. Many laptops lack the software that a high-end desktop would have, but this does not apply to Apple’s Macbook. First, the Mac has capabilities that of gaming desktop computers. Safari is the Mac’s main browser, so what happens if for some reason I need to use Google Chrome? Well, the Mac has the ability to run not only two but three different utilities at once, Google Chrome, Safari, and Bing. Also, the software of the mac allows you to also play desktop games when you want to. Most laptops are meant for business or school, like the Macbook, but not all of them can perform as well as the Mac for games. Sometimes, after school, I explore and test the limits of my laptop just to get a sense for what the max is. I expected the Macbook to do somewhat poorly, but I thought that it actually did pretty well. Another reason why the Macbook is great is because of the battery. The batteries for every computer seem the same, but once looked at in-depth, not all batteries are equal. The Macbook has a very long battery life compared to another laptop, like a Chromebook. When I first used my Macbook, I used it without charging it until it needed it. How long did it last after starting at 50%? Almost one day with no charge. The Chromebook I had when I was in middle school would need to be charged after about five hours of use. Also, the battery uses an optimizing system. When the battery is below 30%, the system turns the battery power done, and thus turns down the brightness of the screen. This helps to maintain the battery for a longer period of time. Not only is the battery great, but for many other reasons this is the best laptop I have had. The Macbook is a modern, efficient laptop for not only students but for all kinds of people. From the battery life, to the software and the modern features, the Macbook is a great laptop to use, no matter who you are and what you do. The Mac will change not only how to get things done, but your view of a laptop forever."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"El artículo genial, pero vino con defectos, la salida de sonido no funciona con los audífonos. NO se que hacer y no contestan las llamadas."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,One of the ports is defective.
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,Ha pasado más en reparación que en uso.
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"Okay, this is a great MacBook, and a significant improvement over its predecessors, very fast laptop. As a student here are my pros and cons.PROS:-Portable for me to carry, I got a hard case for it and a sleeve and it is very portable at 13""-Battery life is fantastic, I literally charged it to 80% yesterday afternoon at 3:00PM, now, as I write this review, it is still going, at 4:06 PM, with 39%. In the past 10-12 hours, I've been using photoshop and Final Cut Pro, finishing my essay and FaceTiming a old friend, it is amazing-M1, the processor is super fast, even though this thing doesn't have a fan, it doesn't get hot at all, I have not seen this thing get warm a single time.-The keyboard, let me put it this way, it is VERY SATISFYING, many people have many opinions about it, but I come from using a MacBook 2017 and Asus Vivobook, this keyboard is very good, has great travel and it isn't mushy.-Display is also very good, gets bright enough, even in direct sunlight and keyboard backlight is adjustable, something I haven't been able to do on my windows laptops.CONS:-App support, plainly putting it, app support sucks other than applications that are optimized for the m1, even as of 2022, but my main apps work, like Final Cut Pro, photoshop and Lightroom.-Webcam sucks, it's still 720p, and much worse than my Asus, it's serviceable but not good."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,Got used crap was supposed to be brand new
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,I didn't like this product at all. It asked for a fingerprint and credit card number.
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,There are lots of ghost images
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"Over the past 10 years, I've had five MacBook Airs and three MacBook Pros (my employer provides a new one for my work every few years, and I upgrade my own at home every 1-2 years).  Most recently, my personal computer has been an early 2020 intel quad core MacBook Pro and my work computer an early 2020 MacBook Air.  The brand new M1 MacBook Air is my favorite by far, and fixes everything I didn't like about the MacBook Air & Pro introduced in early 2020.The M1 MB Air's battery life is amazing, I can use it all day and still have 50-60% battery remaining.  My previous MB Air and MB Pro gave me around 5-6 hours of battery life (despite Apple promising ~10 hours) - which was barely enough to get me through the day.I'm also loving the the fanless design, silent operation, and increased performance.  Even though I don't do much video editing, my workflow can be taxing on the computer:  I regularly run lots of apps simultaneously, including Zoom for teaching, many open browser windows, Excel & statistical/database software, and a connected iPad I use as a digital whiteboard when teaching over Zoom.  The new M1 MacBook Air handles this easily, and does not get hot despite the lack of a fan.  The MB Pro I've used since April (the one introduced in early 2020 with Intel quad core processors) also handles this load well, but it gets warmer and fans kick on sometimes.  The early 2020 MacBook Air buckled under this load, it gets very hot and the fans are screaming.Besides the better battery life, silent operation, and robust performance, the new M1 MB Air has a display with better colors and a slightly better webcam compared to previous MB Airs.The MB Air's display doesn't get as bright as the MB Pro's display - that has been true for years, but it has never been a problem for me.  I would only need the display to be brighter if I were working outside on a sunny day, and I just don't do that.I really love the keyboard on the new M1 MacBook Air, which is the same as the keyboard on the early 2020 MB Air & Pro, and MUCH improved IMHO from the butterfly keyboards on the previous MB Airs & Pros.  It is quiet and super comfortable for typing.  When typing very fast, my accuracy is higher on this keyboard than on the butterfly-style keyboards.This is subjective, but I really prefer the MB Air form factor - the wedge shape and slightly lower weight - compared to the MB Pro.  I also strongly dislike the MB Pro's Touch Bar.  I've had two different MB Pros with Touch Bars and they were nothing but trouble for me.  When typing fast, my fingers would sometimes slightly graze the edge of the Touch Bar, which would trigger a command (like launching the Music app), which would interrupt my workflow.  I know other people don't have that problem, and other people find the Touch Bar useful, but it's just not for me.For me, the MB Air speakers (on this and on the previous model) are quite good for movies or YouTube videos or Zoom/Facetime calls.  The microphone is perfectly satisfactory, though for Zoom calls or when making my own instructional videos I usually plug in a cheap external mic which is a little better.The webcam is still disappointing, even though image quality is SLIGHTLY improved over previous MacBooks.The external design is exactly the same as MacBook Airs from years past.  I like the design pretty well, but Apple will redesign the MB Air & Pro in the next year or so to reduce the bezels which will allow a bigger screen without increasing the size of the computer.  I will want one of those and might regret that I didn't wait.But for now, the M1 MacBook Air is the best MacBook I've ever had, it fixes everything that I didn't like about previous MacBooks (except the webcam) and offers me a really great computing experience in just about every way."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"This MacBook is excellent. I’ve had it for a year now and it’s impressing me more than I thought it ever would. Every day, straight for 1 year and it’s working like a beast, the only thing is to not eat over it as the keyboard gets pretty mucky and you have to get it deep cleaned. In conclusion, this computer is more than a beast than my old 2015 Macbook Pro"
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,This Product is a very tiny device. No power button and lots of confusion navigating the system itself. Very expensive too. Not Good.
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,Had scratches all over the cover of it when it arrived. Sent it back for a refund.
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"I have both an iPad and iPhone so I thought is would be make sense to have a Mac so everything is in one ecosystem, as it were.  To some extent this has indeed proved true and useful.  I am coming from a Surface Pro 7.  The Mac Air's battery life is much less than advertised.  The claim is around 10 hours, I doubt I get 5, and I am mostly doing internet browsing and Word stuff.  Battery life from fully charged was about 1 hour while on Zoom.  The battery life of the Surface is better.  Word for Mac is a little different than Word for a PC, but the differences are minor and manageable.  But documents open more slowly on the Mac, and mine has the M1 chip.  On the Surface, documents usually open immediately.  On the Mac it might take 5 seconds, not an eternity, but a little annoying.  The Surface boots up much faster than the Mac.  I have a DVD with a number of workouts on it.  I could not get any individual workouts to open using the Mac's native software.  So I downloaded VLC.  It works fine on the Mac, but takes a long time to open, about a minute.  This seems to be true of any software not downloaded from the App store, including Firefox.  There do not appear to be Mac apps for either.  On the other hand, the Mac has a better screen than the Surface.  While the Surface is quite a good laptop, it is a marginal tablet, and I almost never use it as a tablet.  When I am not sitting at a desk, I prefer the Mac because the two parts cannot come apart as can happen on a Surface.  The new Mac keyboard works great, maybe a tie with the Surface.  So a mixed bag.  As I mentioned, I like having everything in one ecosystem, so likely that is enough of a benefit to keep the Mac.  I am mulling over upgrading to the MacBook Pro 13 because of its bigger battery, but don't know if I want to spend the extra money."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,I've had this computer for a year now and I've gotta say this thing really chugs through a lot. I usually have a million tabs and the entire Microsoft Office Suite open and this thing just takes anything I throw at it. Only downside is that a lot of apps are not designed for the M1 chip and despite there being virtual desktops for Windows out on the market the performance is still a little shoddy.
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"I was making the switch from Windows to Mac - I could play my games on this passive cooled machine with ease. Warcraft 3 and StarCraft worked no problem since they were converted to 64 bit. Problem is TF2 is still 32 bit and it will not run on my Mac. I got this Mac on special at Costco with the M1 chip. Amazing I can get 60 fps on a passive cooled chip. Great build quality and battery life. Poor application on apples part to prematurely discontinue 32 bit applications. That’s just unacceptable, and I had to return it. I will switch over to Mac in 10 years when apps are converted or no longer used."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,So slow and constantly freezing.
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"i've had my m1 macbook air (16 gb ram, 512 gb storage) for about a year, and it's the best computer i've ever owned. for the majority of users, the base model will be enough, but if you want to upgrade ram, it's not a bad choice. works amazing for everything i do, screen quality is great, audio is pretty good, performance is amazing. all around great laptop for 95% of people."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"I love Linux, i can tolerate windows, usually don't like Mac. It's fine folks like what they like for me, Linux gives the most choice is extensible, and runs so fast on even older hardware, you get infinite support you don't get harassed to use cortana, siri, candy crush itunes etc etc.  Mac usually they push you so hard in this echo system for a lot of stuff i really don't like. it used to be just getting music out of itunes was a pain.well here we are in 2021. I mainly work on linux these days, and wanted a unix style mac because working remote i just needed something with microsoft office, i need that. i am not doing windows development these days. I know there is wsl but there are trade offs on windows. not with mac --  for my use case, so i tried it... gave it another shot really. My timing was seemingly really good. these computer are fantastic. You know what i hate about laptops. when they are 150 degrees melting your nuts and it sounds like you have a jet pack on. I hate that i really do. All of my laptops do this. The mac M1 I am pleased to report doesn't. Screw performance i mean that's great here, but the quiet and note heat that's the feature.This is coming from someone that doesn't want to like Apple. They outsource all these jobs, their stuff is over priced right? I'm not so  sure about the price here. You can buy a mac pro 13 inch that's faster than an i9 for 1500 (if you get 16gb), and the battery is amazing, no heat, no fan, the sound is great, the screen is great, the keyboard is great, it's not a lenovo, but other than that it's about as good as you can get. This machine is so well thought out. I got the pro, the reason i take a lot of calls and wanted the slightly better sound, and boosted battery,but if you don't need that you can just get the air which doesn't have the horrible touch bar. Don't get me wrong. the touch bar would be fine IN ADDITION to normal keys. that's where they went wrong here they got greedy. I digress. The only other issue i see here is the connectivity sucks. It needs ports on both sides and at least 2x ports.All these reviews are usually full of crap. It's just people getting free hardware and writing reviews so they can take a tax deduction, or they are sort marketing. This time it's true. This architecture is a significant advance especially in the laptop space. I 'm not sure if this will translate to a desktop-- risc vs cisc isn't new it been going on for decades, but  for laptops, this is a quantum leap. I don't see any reason for the work i'm doing to use a desktop computer a this point. i have complete portability, i can take calls (amazing calls), work on ms office, general development (vscode, all the jetbrains stuff, docker etc)... i mean for a lot of system stuff i'll still use I'd still use linux, but for work this is a great way to go. What a great product. It really really is. This i as strong of an endorsement i can give if you just need to be productive. After 8 months of hell no more fumbeling around with TPM chips, mics, no being able to share my screen, pleading with my computer to use the right audio device. I like it better than any other laptop i have ever had by far.This thing is really just that good. I've been i this industry for a long time. There are going to have to be some changes in competitors product lines, if Apple continues to maintain this price point and deliver a product of this caliber. I have no question this one is going to eat market share fast. I'd imagine there will be a strong response fro Intel, amd and the software companies.  It's difficult to justify purchasing any other laptop at this moment. I mean just get the air for 1200, just get the extra ram. maybe 500 gb. That's all most people are going to need. Who cares if they release better ones in 6 months. they always do they'll probably cost too much. this is all you need."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"I am a life-long fan of all things Apple.  That being said, after using this laptop for a little over a month, I am still impressed with how awesome this laptop is!  The battery life alone leaves me in awe.  I bought this laptop to use as an online student.  Starting with the battery fully charged, I am easily able to complete all of my online coursework and have plenty of battery power left to stream a movie or two afterwards.  I actually purchased my MacBook Air M1 laptop directly from Apple so I would get the student discount.  I did choose to upgrade my RAM to the 16 GB for an additional $180, and that did cause delivery to take a little longer.  Totally worth it though!  I have not done anything yet on this laptop to really stress-test it, but I have had multiple webpages in the browser, and multiple documents open in Word and PDF docs open with iBooks and Preview.  I have had no problems at all switching between open web sites, apps, or docs.  The only time I started to notice any hint of a problem, it turns out it was because we lost power and therefore our home WiFi was temporarily unavailable, so it had nothing to do with the laptop.While it is a minor inconvenience that Netflix is not available for download thru the app store at this time (Oct 2021), it is easy enough to access their streaming service thru the browser.  The built in speakers are plenty loud enough, but it is quite easy to use your AirPods if you prefer.I highly recommend this MacBook Air M1 to anyone, especially students, looking for a laptop that has a battery that will actually keep up with them all day long without constantly needing to find a power outlet."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"When I was in college, I used both mac and PC and after I graduated I switched exclusively to PC because of the versatility (gaming and upgradability). When I decided to go back to grad school, I decided to give Apple another chance with this laptop because I heard great things and high expectation with the new m1 chip design. I was not disappointed.This new CPU has great speeds and this macbook air runs fantastic for daily moderate use (browsing the web, watching videos, reading, studying, etc. ). I can go to a cafe and use this laptop all day without having to charge it. Also, it's so compact and thin that it's easy to take everywhere! compared to my old macbook from 2012, it is incredibly light. I always had the notion that apple made heavy laptops, but this definitely is easy to carry around.As someone who used a desktop, the keyboard was a bit harder to adapt to. The keys don't have a deep switch as a normal keyboard has, but considering the size of the laptop, it is expected. I can see it being an issue with its small screen. Although it is convenient for me, the size can be inconvenient for those hard of sight. Lastly, the price is steep for a laptop. A PC variant with this money can be used to buy a gaming laptop where Apple normally lacks, but I have yet to try the Apple Arcade on my macbook air. It is also only USB-C which is a turn-off to many, but with a dongle, it is not a problem for me.I would say if you are looking for a laptop to work or study with, this is an easy grab. Make sure you buy a dongle along side of it.TL;DRPros:- battery life- m1 chip- size (easy to carry around)- weightCons:- keyboard- size (screen is a bit small for some)- price- only USB-C"
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"I love this computer, just about everything is made so well on it. I have always been a fan of apple products; about two years ago when my old computer stopped working, I decided to get a MacBook and would absolutely recommend this product. One of my favorite things is the size, it is so easy to carry or fit into almost all bags. Due to the fact that I am an avid apple user, it is super beneficial that all my photos, passwords, and documents are so conveniently transferred to each of my devices. The only bad thing is some softwares are not supported within the apple computer which can be inconvenient for someone who may be a college student like me. Otherwise, the computer is great for college students who do not mind emailing the teacher or going through some loop holes to complete the class."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,I have bought this laptop and now got confirmed with Apple support that my laptop is refurbished which is not mentioned in the listing.Manufacturer told me to solve this issue with Amazon but Amazon CS is telling me they can’t do anything as refund/replace time has passed.The listing is lying and they are selling refurbished laptops.One day my laptop just stopped working and now it cannot be fixed and I need to buy new one.Amazon is refusing to refund.Apple is telling to solve issue with Amazon as I bought it from there
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"I'm new to Macbooks, having used Windows my whole life. I chose this for going back to school because I knew it would last longer and not get buggy like Windows always does. While the transition was a bit rocky at first, now that I somewhat know what I'm doing, I absolutely love this computer! It's small and lightweight, but still feel solid in your hands. The processor is incredibly fast as well as the load up time. I can get signed in and have my notes up in seconds (literally, no joke!), something I could never do with a Windows laptop (I should mention that I bought my computer directly from Apple and upgraded to the 16BG RAM and more storage, which helps immensely with load up time). For those that say the camera is bad- I don't think so. Is it the most amazing camera ever? No, but if you really need higher camera quality for your job, then you should probably go with a Macbook Pro instead of Air. For a Zoom meeting it works just fine. The price is obviously higher than many laptops- that's why I've never used Mac until now- but just think of it as an investment. I know I'll be able to use this for years to come!If you are looking for an efficient, reliable laptop with great performance, look no further!"
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"This product is really amazing, from the long lasting battery giving me about enough time to finish my work, and school work to doing other task on it. Even its M1 CPU making it faster to load websites, and files instead of waiting all day for something to load up, and with its 8GB giving me more then enough room just for school task, and work task as well."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,Not happy with product. Apparently all I'm allowed to say.
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,This laptop is the best
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"Before I begin, I’d like to clarify that I purchased this MacBook on Apple.com.I was kind of reluctant at first to purchase a MacBook due to the expensive pricing. But it was heard that apple products are long lasting and really good quality. I’ve had. Chromebook for 3 years, and the quality is not amazing. I’ve had to bring it for repair multiple times. It also shut down randomly. But not with this MacBook.The MacBook is soo beautiful, and sleek. The rose gold color is so elegant, and the keys are amazing. At the top right hand corner there is a small button that enables Touch ID which is so convenient and easy to work.By just saying “hey, Siri” my automated assistant is summoned and will help me with whatever I need. It comes with so many apps. And so many ways to customize your MacBook.I changed my profile photo, set a quote on my Lock Screen, changed my wallpapers, made widgets, changed my highlight color, accent colors and much much more.It’s so convenient for me to have my zooms open in one browser and the “pages” app open in another so I can take notes while my teachers gives lessons.As shown in the pictures, if you update your MacBook with Big Sur, you can download “Widgetsmith” and customize widgets! My entire MacBook’s aesthetic is so elegant and I just love it. Comparing this to laptops like HP and Dell, as well as Google, there are limited ways you can customize your laptop to your liking.I asked a couple of friends and family members who have MacBooks, and they have had them for 5+ years, without having to take their MacBooks for repair. I am hoping this will be my case as well.I can now message anyone from the messages app and the mail app.The camera quality is great too! It’s touched up my appearance with zoom and Google meet. and I’ve heard if you want a MacBook to edit, the pro is the way to go because the storage is bigger.The battery life is so great too! I’ve used it for 6+ hours starting at 9am to 4:30 pm. It started at 45 percent and it only went down to 30!!!Buying a MacBook will not water your money! I am loving every second of my use!!! Thank you Apple!!! 💜"
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,Not a good computer
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"I was hesitant to get a smaller Macbook after my 15"" 2015 Macbook Pro started to suffer from keyboard issues.  I repaired the keyboard twice, so there must have been something wrong with voltage regulation to it.Anyhow, I couldn't resist the idea of an ARM based Macbook, so I went with the 2020 13"" Macbook Air since I don't think the Pro model had Apple Silicon yet.  I could be wrong on that.Long story short, it meets all my needs with flying colors!  It turns out that I'm perfectly comfortable with a 13"" screen and that I don't need a bigger one.Everything great about this Macbook:- It's *fast*!  Don't let the ""Air"" moniker deceive you.  Unless you're into heavy gaming, this is the laptop for you.  ARM processors are the future of consumer computing.- The battery life is *insane*.  I still can't comprehend how many hours this thing survives unplugged.  I take it on flights across the country and never need to plug in or get worried that I will run out of power, even when I'm charging my phone off it!- It's slim and light!  Perfect for traveling.- It is completely solid state with no moving parts!  No fan whirring or anything like that.- As an extension of the first point, it runs ARM builds of Windows insanely well with Parallels.  It can even run Halo: CE at near full speed!- macOS is very stable.- The retina screen is nice.- Despite what people are saying about the camera, it's actually better than the one on my old Macbook Pro.  (this isn't to say that the camera is *good*, but it's adequate IMO)- All things considered, the M1 Macbook Air is incredible value and really a great deal for the price.- It has a larger touchpad than my old Macbook Pro but not quite as bit as the one on current 13"" Macbook Pros.  I find this preferable because it is just the right size where I'm not constantly hitting it with my palm as I type.  If you type a lot then the touchpad on this laptop will probably annoy you less while still having plenty of surface area.- No touchbar!!!  Halleluja!!!!- Decent sound from the speakers considering the size constraint.There are some cons, but they are pretty minor IMO:- Only the left side has USB-C ports, in contrast to the Pro which has them on both sides.  The right side *does* have an analog audio jack, however, if that's useful to you.  However, I've managed fine without USB on the right side.- It would be nice if I didn't have to click the fingerprint sensor button to get it to sense my finger and wake the system.  On pros, the fingerprint sensor is always active.- If you are one of the 3 people on the planet who want the touchbar, this will not have it. (I however consider this a good thing)- Although the speakers have improved in quality since previous Air models, the Pro is still going to have better sounding speakers.  You may feel like you've gotten a bit of a downgrade in that regard if you are coming from a Pro model.  Personally, I've gotten used to it plus I use AirPods most of the time anyway.- The Air does NOT have an HDMI port, but you can buy an (expensive) adapter that will provide HDMI.- Storage capacity is workable but limited.  Would be nice to get at least 1 TB of storage in the future.  In the meantime I just back stuff up on to an external drive and periodically clear my downloads folder.I'm a software engineer and the M1 Macbook Air exceeds my needs and expectations.  I think I'll just be buying the Air model in the future because it's terrific value for the price point.  $999 might be expensive for some, but I can assure you that it's a robust laptop so you are saving money in the long run.  I've owned many non-Apple laptops in the past and I ended up hating all of them.  On the other hand, I never regret owning an Apple device.  This is coming from someone who formerly used Windows and Linux.  I got tired of both the hardware and software breaking down quickly.  Apple isn't perfect... my last Macbook Pro chugged along for over 6 years until the keyboard repeatedly failed, but that still beats all previous laptops I owned that had numerous problems unrelated to how I treated them."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,Never had trouble with a Mac before.  But they refunded my money.
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,They love it and say its perfect.
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,Gave me a MacBook that was locked no way of getting in
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,Don’t buy stop letting me login in couldn’t reboot either
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,Mac is completely dead.
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"I bought my Macbook Pro in 2013 which makes it 8 years old. It's still going strong. I did have to replace the battery a few years back. I did it myself, bit of a pain as Apple locks their stuff down pretty well. It looks like Apple will drop support for this late 2012 model next year. That's when I'll get a new one. Not bad for close to 10 years for one machine. About a hundred bucks a year."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"I've owned this laptop for a year and a half, and felt compelled to take time out of my frantic day to note that I really think this computer is a giant step backward for the Macbook Air model and for Macintosh as a brand compared to my old 2013 Macbook Air running Yosemite.The lack of a mag-safe connection for the charger is really unforgivable, and this computer has wound up on the floor so frequently that I now have placed the dog bed where the laptop is likely to land.  The keys are beginning to stick.  The screen is beautiful, but gives me a terrible headache.  The memory pressure issue with the M1 is also a real problem in Safari, which locks up about every three weeks if you have a lot of windows open-- and it take a LONG time to force quit safely and recover lost work.  The laptop is also too big-- that extra inch or so of width really makes a difference.  The loss of practical functionality in iTunes is really disappointing, iMovie and Garage band have become much, MUCH harder to use in Big Sur as well, and Apple's insistence on trying to force me into using the kloud is both intensely irritating and very dangerous for my business, where confidentiality is absolutely critical.It is true that the processing speed for offline tasks is impressive-- my music projects do sound much better-- and photo and video editing is great.But the M1's speed is not enough of a reason for me to bond with this computer.  As the months have rolled by, honestly, I've come to kind of hate it.  I'm looking forward to refurbishing my old Macbook Air, and I'm thinking this may be the last Apple product that I buy, even though I can't think of a suitable alternative.I am a 64-year old professional health care provider who has been in IT since the early 1980s, and while it's true that I have generally been very unhappy with how gratuitously awful the end-user interface of most tech products have become over the last quarter century, there are some computers that I have actually liked-- my old Macbook Air was definitely one of them.  This is definitely not."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,It wouldn’t even turn on
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,I love the screen quality even tho it’s not touch screen I love it and it’s so easy to use and perfect for all my classes it’s super light and portable
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"The media could not be loaded.
                



 Casi ni la uso y el teclado esta muy malo"
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"I absolutely love my new MacBook.  When it arrived I answered a few questions, connected it to my WiFi and off I went.  It has been a buttery smooth experience.  Keyboards are one of those things that are dependent on user preferences, but for me it's the best feeling keyboard I have ever owned.  Many professional reviewers agree it's terrific. The multi-touch pad is brilliant, and now that I know the many different combinations of fingers and movements I zip around getting work done.  For example a two-finger swipe right goes back to the previous web page, no need to hit that back button.  It is also custom configurable to your touchpad needs. What I appreciate most is the total cost of ownership value.  I bought Final Cut Pro X when it came out 10 years ago yet there was no charge to get the latest version downloaded from the App Store. It does everything I need without an ongoing subscription fee like others have.  I still can't get used to how fast it works, it took me an hour to render a video on my old Mac but this MacBook did it in just a few minutes.  And it's cool and quiet! I'm using a huge 70"" 4K monitor as my secondary monitor.  Battery life is ridiculous.  I plug it in every 2 or 3 days depending on my workload, which is several hours per day.  I think the web camera is fine for me and many notebooks use this same 720p size.  I join one Zoom conference per week, so it doesn't really matter. The one thing I hope gets updated with the next release are the ports.  I'm using a hub because it only has two thunderbolt ports. I recommend this notebook to all my friends and family."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"I got this MacBook Air for work, because my personal laptop is a 2019 Razer Blade, and while thin, it’s heavy and runs hot…like gaming laptops do.I decided to get a MacBook Air M1 256g for a work laptop, and had no real expectations for it. I’ve been very impressed.The quality is what you’d expect from Apple, sturdy construction, I love the keyboard, the display is solid and shows a depth that my other laptops never have. It has handled everything I’ve thrown at it, zooms, huge files of client contracts, browsing of course, I haven’t ever noticed it throttling due to a lack of a fan.It’s operating system is very user friendly too, some tasks that are a bit more difficult in a PC are astonishingly easy. Honestly, I haven’t even touched the Razer Blade in a few months, I will always have an apple laptop from here on out."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,Not very user friendly not in love with it
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,Sucks
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,Product was broken
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"The MacBook Air is a great purchase for a laptop. It has many new features that will be helpful for school and work. The laptop is affordable, portable, and has the new M1 chip. The way the laptop is affordable is because you will be able to pay for it monthly so you will not spend all your money at once. You will also be getting what you pay for with its latest features. It is also portable because it is light weight and slim. This will help you carry it anywhere you need to and will be very helpful if you go to college, since you will be carrying from class to class. Lastly, it has a new M1 processing chip. This M1 chip makes it better than any past MacBooks, it keeps you laptop running smooth and fast, it also gives you long battery life. I really do recommend you purchase the MacBook Air, it is worth buying."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,Unable to remake the installation system
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,fits and protects my new Apple Air.
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,This was the best and I'm not even a fan of apple products. Now I'm getting a Apple Iphone!
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"This MacBook Air, I think Steve Jobs would have a smile on his face if he sees it.  So fast, so light, the battery can seem to last forever.  You may think, for such a small volume, can they just put a battery it in, or just a screen and keyboard in it. No, they put the whole computer in it, and super fast, last super long on the battery.  I have used computers for more than 30 years and I have to say, this is the summit of our civilization."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"I bought 2 m1 macbooks when they came out, waited for delivery patiently. Canceled 1 B&H and bought 1 here and got the other from B&H. Ive been using macs since the colored clamshells.  I still have 12+ year old Imac as and afraid to say to jinx myself it but love the big imac that replaced it for my office a few years ago.  IM sloppy and like to sit in bed and watch youtube while working or doing whatever I need to.  To the meat, these have both had quite few issues. Mine had the control key get stuck and by the grace of god and yt vids, I used sloppykeys or whatever it was after athourough cleaning to make it work.  My partner, I shut theres and apparently a piece of rice was near the trackpad and when we opend it the screen was broken, not cracked but no longer vicible.  Ive had so many macs develop issues. The biggest one they made was over 2k many years ago and had the known logic board failure.  I didnt know until after, my logic board died , even though faulty, they wouldnt cover past warranty.  Making a faulty product in america means anything after a certain time no longer counts even though it was they who made something that would fail.  I have 2 last gen macbooks both missing keys so external keybpoard only.Apple makes products with a lot of flaws. i think they were excellent back 10+ years ago but now I dread the company. i stopped buying iphones after mutiple died for various reasons, charger ports. etc. using sloppy cheap android now.  your identity should not revolve around corporations, were wasteful and gross.  Now Im down one macbook and not wanting to buy another with protection racket coverage but why pay more for a an m2 w pretty muc no difference or a 14"" for twice the price.A companies politics of greed and un-excellence makes me hate buying from them but to my not caring to re=learn (I have a chrome book to un-apple but dont like it) . OS i guess I;; buy another of the same less than 2 years later w applecare which Im sure iwll be great to handle.  All of my apple book and phone products failCompanies like apple are why this country is in the toilet."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,wow
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"I bought this laptop last year for work and school and have had nothing but problems with it. My calendar randomly deleted most of my events and it commonly will not load or displays other problems. Apple has been garbage lately, and my phone was even causing problems with data issues and battery problems. I went and bought all Windows devices so I have more control over the technology."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"Full disclosure, bought from Best Buy open box for a much better price and convenient same day pick up.Shouldn't surprise anyone, build quality is top of the line, feels ultra premium, track pad, screen and keyboard are perfect. Screen is actually amazing, makes a huge different coming from even an IPS windows laptop. Fanless is truly fantastic, laptop stays cool with demanding tasks while sipping battery. I sat there for 5 hours doing some serious writing and safari browsing, and barely lost ~20%. I'd imagine you could get a couple days with casual/moderate use.This laptop solves all the problems of the previous Air's, it doesn't get super hot and the fans kick on obnoxiously loud. Performance is top notch, and the only real downfall is the lack luster webcam, but I'm not knocking off a star because every laptop has at least one compromise. This is a compelling package for the price, especially if you get more than 3 years out of it which is very doable. Overall was very impressed with this machine coming from a Ryzen 3500u Windows laptop.Edit: Be warned, buying from Amazon is a hassle when it comes to returns. With expensive products like this Macbook, you will need to jump through hoops just to get permission to return and the only option is a UPS pickup which is very inconvenient. Just a heads up, unless you want to end up with Amazon tech support for hours."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,if you want the most unreliable computer ever then buy this one.
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,Nice Laptop
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,Purchased as a replacement upgrade for older MacBook. Very happy with screen and battery life. We also own MacBook PRO and one other Mac Air so we're picky! Highly recommended.
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"This M1 is such a leap ahead for Apple. It has great battery life, no heat, and is fast and versatile. I  ordered the 512 model, but as a casual user, I don’t know if I will ever use all that memory. I think that many people could order the 256 base model, and save some bucks. An external drive is cheaper than built in memory. The fingerprint sensor is wonderful!"
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"okay so, pretty great laptop. it doesn’t overheat, the camera is better than my previous macbook, and it runs pretty well. the only problem i have is that extensions like chrome keep crashing. as a student using google meet and zoom for 7 hours a day i really can’t be crashing in the middle of a class. i’m not big on tech, so i’m not that picky, but i hope this problem sorts itself out."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"I encourage people who have had a bad taste left in their mouth by older (Intel) MacBooks, like myself, at least try out an M1 machine in person and see the difference.Compared to my older Core i5 MacBook: no more ridiculous heat and fan noise, no hit on performance with a bunch of apps open, and I could continue this list but *oh my god the battery.* I will watch a few YouTube videos, listen to music, edit some documents then check the battery percentage... to see it has gone down at most a handful of %, on pretty high brightness. It's a remarkable accomplishment that will surely change the way I use and transport my laptop. App compatibility has not been an issue for me at all, but it's worth I do not use any niche developer / engineering tools."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,This thing spazzes out when running google chrome and 1 other application.
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"Yes there are bezels but honestly who cares?  This package delivers an extremely strong value as someone who spends most of their time in a browser, working on excel and word.  Chrome has not posed any issues so far with many extensions and two profiles running simultaneously as of the time of writing mid december.  8gb of ram is more than enough to run a multitude of apps thanks to apple's strong os optimization.This one is a keeper, I've been trying out macbooks for awhile and was always unhappy with something. Don't get me started with the battery life, it is so good that I spend most of my time off the charger.Most average joes looking for a daily driver or work from home computer will be satisfied with this.  As long as apple continues to support the first gen of desktop silicon for a long time like everything else, then I have no doubt this will last for a long time."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"I have had this MacBook Air in the gold color for a few months now. This is actually my very first MacBook. I absolutely LOVE it. First of all, it is gorgeous. I am a sucker for cute packaging or a cute product, and this laptop is just stunning. I have never seen a beautiful laptop until I got this.The performance is amazing as well. Super long battery life; I rarely have to charge it. Super thin. Never gets hot. Super fast. The 4k performance is beautiful. I would buy this again in a heartbeat. Definitely worth the price.  I looked at all of the MacBooks in person before buying, and the Air is just stunning with its thin design. Did not like the looks of the Pro models!"
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"i believe i bought this in march, it’s currently may. when i got it the box wasn’t damaged or anything. but the caps lock button and space bar malfunction. sometimes i have to press them multiple times for them to work."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"Yup.  This M1 MacBook Air is everything the online reviewers said it was--amazingly fast, agile, and smart.  It blows away all earlier MacBook Airs as well as most other laptops on the market.  I'm not much of a tech nerd, so the specs and numbers don't mean much to me.  I'm a writer.  So I appreciate the feel, ease, and portability of the machine.  Plus, I'm delighted with the keyboard--heads and tails better than the faulty ""butterfly"" keyboard on my old 2017 Air.  All in all, this is a great small laptop.  Solid, but light.  Lightning fast and nimble.  It is a great step up from the older Intel machines.  And I'm not in the least bothered that the external design is the same as the older models.  It's a classic and fully functional shape, so why change?  Well done, Apple."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"The move to M1 has made this model an instant classic. If you like MacOS and need a daily driver person or light-load professional laptop, just buy it.Pros:Huge jump in battery life over competitors and previous generationExcellent performance with no fan noise and no heatGreat value for priceLight weight, perfect industrial designGreat displayCons:Higher refresh rate (120hz+) would be niceWebcam is outdated"
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"The new MacBook Air with the M1 chip is overall amazing! It’s definitely worth the money! The all-new chipset has turned the Air lineup into a beast! My only complaint is the camera. Apple has stuck to the same 720p camera and claiming the neural engine makes it better? I’m not convinced it’s any better, and it’s really a disappointment compared to other notebooks in its class. Also, the inability to adjust the keyboard brightness from the keyboard. It’s adjustable from the settings and easily accessible… but it’s just an inconvenience. It’s a petty complaint but for the money, this should be standard (it previously was on older models). Aside from that, this notebook is amazing! Lightning fast and the best battery life I’ve ever seen! Overall, if you’re in the Apple ecosystem and you’re looking for an amazing laptop with all day battery life - this is the one for you!"
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,The product was great at first. But after having it for a little over a year it completely stopped working (not turning on and a complete black screen) and there was no physical or liquid damage to it. And Apple wants me to spend $500 to fix the laptop that was just over a year old. Terrible customer support policies.
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"I got this because my 2015 iMac was having trouble with video editing. Everyone said the M1 chip was so powerful that this thing would be able to handle most video editing with no problem, and at first that seemed right. It lags less when I'm actually editing. But today I exported a video with a very simple blur filter and this thing can't even play the exported video without freezing. Tried restarting and everythingAbsolute garbage for the money, this thing is just an overpowered internet browser"
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,I'm a big techie and after seeing all the benchmarks had to get the M1. It's truly a game changing processor. My wife and I love this laptop. There's a slight adjustment as I'm a lifelong Windows user but MacOS is intuitive enough that it's not too bad. I tried to make the switch with Safari but it lacks profiles so I'm on the Brave browser. Brave works great and have had no issues so far. I also use signal and Bitwarden and both work fine.Apple really knocked the ball out of the park with this machine. The one true con is the crappy webcam. Aside from that this is the best laptop money can buy on the market hands down.
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,Brought this from apple directlyDisplay started showing Vertical stripes within 20 days of purchaseAnd yes not in stock for replacementApple was helpful in refunding the moneyI would recommend to go for 512 GM ssd256 GB only gives you to 140 Gb odd space to work with
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,Upgraded from Mid 2015 base Macbook Air. This thing is like 100x faster. It is amazing. I got used to the USB-C and bought a little hub that makes it a non issue. Actually like it better since USB C is faster. Battery life on my old MacBook was amazing. This one is literally at least double that. Pro tip do not use chrome on any Mac or MacBook it is energy and efficient and will kill your battery (took me a while to learn this). Webcam is only bad part but all Macbooks have substandard webcams compared to iPhones. I got the base model and do NOT regret it one bet- I saved a ton of money on one less core and I do NOT notice a difference (heard its 10% or less). This thing is razor thin!
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"Granted I'm coming off a MBP 8/500 dual-core i5, but this thing is read-my-mind fast.  I keep quitting apps out of habit when you just don't need to.  Keyboard is back to pre-butterfly goodness, sound is great, and with a dock like the Anker 7-in-1 you will not mind the port count.  GarageBand and iMovie never miss a beat.  On geekbench, these new M1 units are surpassed only by the xeon Mac & iMac Pros and the 8-core i9 iMac.  Same no-go apps as Catalina, so no real surprises.  Can't wait for more universal binary apps, it'll only get better."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,I’m looking for a laptop that is has after effects available
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"My son loved his Apple laptop while it worked. The screen has cracked twice. As we can see from the image, it cracks from the top middle where Apple put the camera. My son used the laptop a lot, but he did not mistreat his laptop. I generally do favor Apple products. Apple already repaired this once. I paid nothing for that repair. However, it has now failed twice for the same issue. I feel this is a serious engineering defect. I likely will take it to Apple so they can diagnose it. I don't particularly care if I get the laptop back or not at this point since I suspect it may break again within six months. Unfortunately I cannot recommend the Apple Macbook Air due to this defect. I do expect a laptop to last at least 2 or 3 years. Apple normally makes great products and I hold Apple in high esteem. This product unfortunately is not one of them. Not all of the Apple laptops will face this issue. But if you search the web you will find others who have experienced this same problem. I am hoping Apple stress tests newer versions of their laptops to address this issue in the future. Apple may need to modify the camera assembly or display assembly. Or relocate the camera to a different location like the corner of the display."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"I’ve been purchasing on Amazon and never get disappointed. This laptop is gorgeous and LOOKS BRAND NEW! I can’t afford brand new laptop due to other school expenses and so I was so excited to buy it. You’ll only end up returning this laptop at the end. Also, I came back to see if there’s new buyer but the price caught my attention. They higher up the price and with $900 you can afford to buy brand new MacBook Air M1."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,Tried to use afterpay but the company waits days to try to charge the card and by then the afterpay is expired. Never had this issue with any other purchase but have tried 3 times and all 3 times a FAIL! Do not recommend Bc you won’t get in 2 days like promised!
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"Disclaimer: purchased a special order 16GB/512GB directly from AppleUsage: general purpose web browsing, office work, programming in Python, casual photo editingBattery: excellent. I can go the entire day without charging with my screen brightness turned up all the way up.Responsiveness: quick to do what I want it to do.M1 compatibility: lots of apps are jumping to support M1 natively; Rosetta does the job and I have no complaintsKeyboard: good typing feel"
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"I traded in my previous MacBook Air for the current version with the M1 chip. I have only had it for four days and all I can say is wow! I didn't think I would notice much of a difference, but I am very impressed with the speed and the battery life of this new edition. I mainly use my laptop for emailing, paying bills, and web browsing, and I purchased this model instead of the Pro because I don't edit or shoot videos. This model is perfect for my needs."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"This review is for the MacBook Air.  Bought this brand new, not refurbished, in November 2021.  Frequently clear history and reboot, and even that does not really help.  Sometimes it has normal page loading, but about half the time, it is slow, slow, slow, even with all apps but safari closed.  I only use it for surfing the web, no gaming, but it is SLOW.  Pages frequently take over a minute to load, regardless of the website.I called Apple, which says it has no authenticated reports of this issue.  I have ordered an Acer now so that I will have reliable internet access but I think this Apple for the price should have provided that."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"I couldn't ask for more from a $900-1000 laptop.  The trackpad, the keyboard, the screen, the performance, the battery life, all great 👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍"
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"I've been using this laptop for the past month and is working out great! I love the battery life, i've only charged it 4 times😜."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,This happened to my buddy Eric
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,amazing
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"Why is there only two reviews and hardly anyone purchasing this item?. Must not be a good product compared to other similar ones listed here. Or the price is too high, one of the two."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"Absolutely incredible. Apple has outdone themselves with this new M1 chip. If you are Windows user looking for a new laptop, and you are okay with trying out macOS, I would say this purchase is a no-brainer."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"No complains so far. Very fast and performs great. I had a 2020 March version of MacBook Pro and I think this November release is better.  Battery life is much better and also, audio and video seem improved compare to older release."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"The laptop seems fine but the box and laptop and adapter cord wreaked of mold. I would have returned it, but needed a computer immediately for work."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"I run 11ish, an investment website and channel on youtube. I was hesitant about whether this laptop will handle video editing or not since I came from a 2016 macbook pro, but this has outperformed it through and through! Fast and reliable. The only problem I ran into was actually migrating past iMovie content over"
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"Apple USED to make great computers... Past tense! I've used them for many (almost 20) years but recently bought this computer in December and my sentiments about this brand has completely changed. How the mighty have fallen!I was always the biggest Apple supporter. I have purchased many as gifts for relatives as well as bought them for myself. From the Apple watches to the screens and desktops to the macbook pros, macbook airs and phones. I defended them against the Apple haters and always had their backs. I thought I was going to be Apple for life. I even own many shares of their stock, which I will be dumping soon because I see the writing on the wall. I could tell something was up with them as Apple continues to have great earnings reports but their stock doesn't move. It's the biggest slug of a stock. I now think I have stumbled upon the reason why.If you google the recent complaints about Apple you will see. Apple does not have the great customer service they once had. I was mistaken to think they did. They have also started cheaping out... big time. The result? Products that don't last. Couple that with customer service that could give a flying eff if you remain a customer of theirs and I'm sensing a recipe for disaster unfolding here... Selling all of my $AAPL stock ASAP stat.Warning, do not buy this computer! Apple's quality has gone wayyy downhill.The MacBook Air cords are absolutely horrendous! I am on my third Apple cord in less than 6 months. I brought the product to an Apple store and the employee denied that there was any problem with their cords and instead blamed me. He told me I must be doing something wrong. Nothing has changed about my usage of their products. I've always used them the same way and never had issues with my cords until the computer was really old. Think years and years. Not months. So you'd think if I was the problem like this guy tried to say I was, I'd be going through computer cords right and left, right? Well I haven't. And looking up my account would prove that. However, Apple doesn't care. They want to charge me for to replace their defective products anyway.Welcome to the new Apple where the customer is always WRONG.Then the guy doubled down and told me that he'd been working at the Apple store for 10 years and I'm the ONLY person who has ever had a problem with their cord. A simple google search has proved that to be completely false. Everybody complains about the quality of their cords. This must be huge business for them selling cords like this.So the employees gaslight you and will blame you if something goes wrong. If you want to sign on for that, good luck. I hope you never run into a problem and see what I'm talking about but you'll be fooling yourself because it will only a matter of time. I am DONE! I work too hard for my money and they aren't the only computer show on the road. Lucky for me I speak PC too.Thanks for nothing Apple! Good job burning that bridge. You just lost a loyal customer over $19. Hope it was worth the extra $$$$. It's not the money Apple. It's the principle. I won't do business with companies who treat me like that, period. Peace out!"
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,GREAT!!! Came on time!!!
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"Beware:  reliability and customer support is gone.  I bought a MacBook Air about 2 years ago. From the beginning, it malfunctioned, intermittently failing to allow me to access any other apps besides the one I was using.  I worked with numerous Apple technicians who also witnessed the problem.  After hours and hours over months of patiently working with them, I was told we’d try a complete replacement of the OS and if that didn’t work, I’d get a replacement. When it didn’t, I was told I’d now have to take disk images and record dates and times it failed. They’d have the “engineers” get involved.  “The engineers” for one faulty laptop after I’d been patient for two years doing everything they asked, and they witnessed the problem.  Two years, hours upon hours of my life and a false commitment to make it right. I’ve been a Mac user for decades.  No longer.  Given the premium price + AppleCare, I feel cheated and so disappointed.  I’ll be looking for a new non-Apple laptop."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"If you purchase the MacBook Air with the M1 chip YOU WILL NO LONGER BE ABLE TO RUN WINDOWS ALONG WITH MAC OS!  If your buying specifically to just use the Mac OS & don’t have a problem not being able to run Windows or any program that runs on Windows, then this system is a good Apple product.  If you are like myself (or want the option like you SHOULD JUST HAVE as has always been offered in the past with processors before the M1 and run Windows on a partitioned drive either with MAC OS, or boot up into Windows instead, the M1 chip now takes that ability to do so away!  The MacBook Air itself with the M1 chip now that they’ve finally incorporated the ability to run iPhone apps on it is in itself a huge breakthrough.  That was overall my biggest frustration with using MacBooks by a long shot.  And it seems they’ve fixed that now, so on one end impressive if your simply not needing Windows or anything that runs in the Windows environment of course."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"I was using a 2015 MacBook Pro for doing video editing for my church, and when I saw the specs on the M1 based MacBook Pro, I upgraded for faster processing.  My existing system has an Apple monitor, wi-fi keyboard and mouse, and a WD 3 TB external drive.The two USB-C ports on the new MacBook Pro are inadequate!  I also bought a new 27"" LG monitor because I couldn't figure out how to use the old monitor with the new computer.  The LG monitor has 4 USB-C ports on the back, so I assumed would give me enough connections for my devices.  WRONG!!!!!Only one of the LG ports is Lighting compatible, so I had to use it to connect and power the laptop.  I had to buy a USB-C to Displayport adapter, plus a Displayport to Firewire adapter to connect my external drive, but this wasn't supported over the monitor's USB-C ports, it had to be connected to the remaining Lightening port on the laptop.  This consumed all the easily accessible ports!Then I had to buy a USB-C to USB3 adapter to connect my camera and other devices to the computer.  All behind the monitor.  It's a royal pain!  I've got it working, but I'm unhappy with the cludge.  I don't understand why Apple put together such a capable laptop with so limited connection capabilities.  I'm going to be d*****g with this terrible configuration for years.On the positive side, their claims of faster processing are true.  I can put together a church video, then export it to a file in 1/2 the time as my old laptop.  Even the upload speeds to YouTube seem to be faster."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,Best one I had ever
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,My favorite thing about this new macbook is the ability to listen to music beautifully at the first level of volume. At max volume a theater can hear it.
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,Awesome macbook
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"I have ONLY owned and used Apple computers/phones for the last 35 years.  This is the worst one yet.  Bought it for my online job come to find out it has the SLOWEST WIFI ... ""A Known Problem"" by Apple as well.  Yet though don't tell you or even Fix it.  Super disappointed.  My macbook air 2013 has faster wifi speed than this one.Buyer BEWARE"
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"The only computers I've ever owned have been Macs, starting with a Mac SE in 1987. This is the first time I've bought one that has mainly made me angry.I quickly discovered that I couldn't plug it into my printer because it doesn't have a USB port, so I had to buy a USB-C to USB adapter: $19.I also can't charge it using any of the chargers around my house from my old MacBooks or my husband's MacBook, so in order to have an extra charger, I had to pay $49. When it arrived, I realized it didn't come with a cord. Another order; another $19.And Apple is no longer using MagSafe connectors, so if you accidentally hit the cord with your foot or whatever, the cord doesn't just pop out of the computer. Instead, it drags your computer with it. Yesterday, just a month after getting my expensive new computer, I dragged it to the floor and broke the screen. It'll cost me $500 to get it fixed, if I don't decide to throw it into a dumpster.I now officially hate Apple. What's especially annoying is that they've successfully addicted me to their products, and I know I'm not going to change brands at this point in my life, so I'm going to keep having to put up with this kind of crap from Apple, plus how they're always trying to invade my privacy and force me to use iCloud and how their software now tries to make way too many decisions for me.I'm writing this review on my old 2015 MacBook Air and, even though it's slower than the new MacBook and the display is smaller and not as nice, I'm wondering if I really want to fix my new MacBook."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,Apple is not standing behind this product.  We bought this laptop in 12/2020.  We activated it but my husband changed his mind.  It sat in our office for 1 1/2 years  We just plugged it in for my granddaughter for college and it won't charge.  Apple wants $428 to fix with only 90 day warrantee.  It has no trade in value and was never hooked up to the internet.  So sadI have a much older MacBook Air that has been fine.
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"The M1 chip really is amazing. But it only lasted five days for me. Somehow mine managed to break after using a third party USB C hub. The screen wouldn’t turn on at all, and an Apple repair tech couldn’t figure it out after doing a few quick tests. Oh and then Apple said it would take a month to replace it with a new one."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"Owned a 2016 MacBook Air that had display issues from the get-go, but Apple said it might be okay if I was super careful handling it.  I couldn’t go without a laptop for 2 weeks so decided to risk it.  After a couple yrs of being super careful the display became distorted after just a slight bump, and after the warranty period of course.  Used it hooked up to the TV only for about a year, but as that was difficult in itself (overheating, prevented sleep function, etc), had to change course.  Didn’t wanna pay $550 for a new display, so…… bought the M1 2020 MacBook Air instead. Seemed to be operating well until 8 months in, when I wasn’t even anywhere near it and the display went totally out.  Wouldn’t turn on after repeated powering down so called Apple.  They had me power on with that shift-control for 10 secs and it went on again. However, considering my experience with my last laptop took no chances and brought it in to Apple.They ran diagnostics and found that the ambient light sensor wasn’t working.  That’s what automatically dims and brightens the screen when going into dark or bright places, in case you, like I, didn’t really know what it did.  Had never dropped this or mishandled it in any way.Sent in my laptop for repair and it’s now been more than a week without and they’re still “diagnosing” it.  Luckily my old laptop is still semi-functional if I hook it up to my TV.  And I still had a few months left in the warranty.  But what if it didn’t and I didn’t have the old one still functional?Two times in a row MacBook Air with serious display issues in the last 5 yrs, with no accidental damage from me. Aside from this, has superior speed and processing power, doesn’t overheat, but still takes 20-30 sec to power up and the touchpad functionality and the feel of both it and the keyboard are terrible when compared to the 2012 I used to have.If you buy an Apple laptop now Apple care plus is almost mandatory.  Will have to seriously consider going back to Windows for my next laptop."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"(Heads-up, this review will be lengthy, but I wanted to cover every aspect to make sure you make the right buying choice).The MacBook Air has always been known as a popular choice for college students over the years due to the lightweight, slim design and good battery life. One caveat that has always plagued the MacBook Air of year’s past was underwhelming performance due to underclocked, lower-powered processors (which were always reserved for the “Pro” line). That was why I always got a MacBook Pro in year’s past. This time around, when Apple announced the new M1 chip, I was curious, so I watched hours and hours of reviews and decided to pull the trigger on the new Air (the Air has the same chipset as the MacBook Pro, with the same GHz at 3.2, while saving $300). I am on a budget, but I also didn’t want to sacrifice performance, so I was a little nervous I was missing out by not getting the Pro, but thankfully I have not had to sacrifice a thing.I am a full-time digital design student, so my workflow can be demanding at times with running Adobe Photoshop and Adobe InDesign, etc. I previously purchased a 2017 MacBook Pro and it was my daily driver until about mid-March when I made a grievous error and went out and purchased a Lenovo Yoga C940 with 16GB of Ram, Intel i7 Processor at a whopping price tag of $1500.00. Buyer’s remorse soon followed as the Yoga was plagued with overheating issues, thermal throttling and absolutely horrific battery life. The only thing that I liked was the speaker set-up and the 4K touch screen. Other than that, I was beyond disappointed. I sent it back, and went back to using my 2017 MacBook Pro, until I purchased this Air.So the pro’s:Fantastic battery life—I have a tough time killing the battery on this computer. It will easily last an entire day, and even longer if you aren’t totally hammering this thing with demanding apps like I do. It’s great to know you don’t have to always carry a charger with you everywhere (you can carry from class to class, the coffee shop and back home and it’ll still have battery to spare). A win in my book.Heat management and fanless design—I am super nit-picky about heat management and fan noise when it comes to laptops, which is why I always love the MacBooks and detest Windows (hence sending the Lenovo back).  The fact that this computer is fanless and manages to stay cool to the touch boggles my mind. I don’t have to worry about a computer than will get so hot that you can fry an egg on it, or annoying fans kicking on. I also like that I don’t have to worry about blocking any ventilation grills, since there is no fan. I can sit in bed with covers under this and not worry I’m blocking a fan exhaust.  Again, another win in my book.Slim design—at 2.8 pounds, and having a tapered design, you can throw this thing in a backpack and not feel like you’re lugging around a brick. I also liked the tapered design as it’s a little more ergonomic than my MacBook Pro that has some really sharp edges by the trackpad. It’s a nice change for someone that has to type up essays all of the time.Keyboard—gone are the butterfly mechanisms of MacBook’s past. One thing I really missed when I gave up my 2015 MacBook Pro was the keyboard! Thankfully with the new Air and Pro’s, you get the scissor switch mechanisms back, so my fingers don’t feel like they’re hitting bottom when typing for long periods of time.Trackpad—I love, love the force touch trackpad. I still believe Apple has one of the best trackpad designs of any laptop out there. Hands down. It’s smooth as butter.Performance—This is the little machine that could. It puts my 2017 Pro to shame. It also outperforms the Lenovo that was supposed to be top of the line, at a fraction of the cost. I can have multiple tabs in Safari open, Photoshop, Apple Music, Microsoft Word, and this doesn’t even break a sweat. I also like that I can do some light video editing on this. For most people—especially college students—this computer’s power should be more than sufficient. Keep in mind if you are a professional videographer or photographer, you might want to opt for the Pro as it does have a fan and can sustain heat management better in terms of thermal throttling. Again, that’s if you’re editing like multiple 4K videos on a daily basis, but for college students or the average Joe that may only need to do the occasional video project—no problem! This computer can handle it!Screen—It’s nice and bright, and the color accuracy is on point, which is important if you edit photos or videos in any capacity like I do.Speakers—I am a music junkie, and I have to constantly have music going when I’m working on school projects, and for such a thin and light laptop the speakers on this are actually pretty good. Good stereo separation and punchy. They could do with a little more bass, and when you max the volume it can get a little faded, but that’s to be expected for such small speaker drivers. I am more than pleased with them. They also work good for binge-watching shows on Netflix.The cons (there are few):The webcam—it’s a 720P webcam, and well, it looks like a 720P webcam. It’s a little grainy and washed out. It will do in a pinch, but you’d think in 2020 we’d get an upgrade on the webcam.The lack of ports—in true Apple fashion, the I/O is somewhat lacking. You have 2 thunderbolt 4 ports, of which you cannot plug in an external GPU, and are limited to one external monitor (this is a limit that Apple’s M1 system on a chip, not the thunderbolt ports, which I am sure will be resolved in future iterations). I would have liked to have seen at least one USB-A port for legacy things like flash drives, etc. But that’s just me being nit-picky.M1 chip running Intel apps—because Apple’s M1 chip runs on ARM and most apps are coded for Intel, there are many apps that have not been optimized to run the new Apple chip natively (like Adobe Creative Cloud). You might run into a few glitches and hick-ups while app developers are getting up to speed. So far, I haven’t really run into any issues, but there is that possibility. I am sure here soon it won’t be a problem. Again, it’s nit-picking.--To sum up: this MacBook Air is a winner. I would absolutely not hesitate to recommend this to anyone, and I would absolutely buy it again. You get the performance and the portability, while saving some $ by not buying the Pro line. I am very happy with this computer and think I might just have come as close as I can to the perfect laptop for my needs.Happy shopping!"
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"I very recently purchased (from the Apple Store, not Amazon) a bran new Macbook Pro with M1 chip. Buyer beware!!!! I've been a Mac and Apple user exclusively for the last 15 years or so. I cannot express how bad this M1 mac is. I bought it for work (professional audio, recording, live audio, Protools etc.) and it literally failed at everything that I needed it to do.Once I got back from a 7 week run on the road with a musical act, I tried to return the computer to the store, but to no avail. It was past the 2 week return window. Apparently Apple does not stand by their product anymore. They wouldn't refund me or even exchange it for a different model (with Intel chip). So I spent $1600 on a new computer that literally failed at all the work tasks that I really needed it to do and there is no recourse. Not to mention that for $1600 you get 2 thunderbolt/usb-c ports. Because of this I ended up purchasing a high quality docking station ($280) and still some of the features that I was counting on like the AVB network protocol would not work on this M1 Mac (unless you buy 2, yes 2, Apple adaptors to use in tandem). Sounds like a rip off right? I've literally spent days and hours on the phone with support from Apple, Windows, Parallels, OWC, Kensington and at the end of the day the M1 mac just isn't compatible with so many things.I've been a staunch Apple user and fan for many years, but this experience might just bring me back to Microsoft.Please stay clear of these M1 macs and don't count on the Apple store to provide you with excellent service (unless you are about to hand them over a few thousand dollars for a new computer that underperforms).For $1600 + $300 (for docking station and case) I got a bunch of disappointment, stress, frustration. Literally the worst purchase I've ever made.Regarding the Apple Store where I made the purchase: They apparently are in the business of taking a customer's money, but not in the business of providing said customer with anything else except a bad product."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"First, I will say I bought this at an Apple store, not on Amazon.  So this is a review of the product.  For many years, I have found Apple products to be overrated and overpriced.  That includes this product.  For example, as others have stated - no good ports (you need to buy all kinds of attachments), no touchscreen, etc.  And, of course, there are compatibility issues with anything not made by Apple.  But my biggest beef is that it is not reliable.  I recently downloaded Monterey - and am having all kinds of problems.  I find all these 5 star reviews hard to believe."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"This is our second Macbook Air.  The first one lasted nearly 5 years and was a rock-solid laptop. The new m1 machines are garbage. Do some research on the internet. The screens break and Apple denies there is a problem.  We have had this one for about 8 months and the screen just broke a second time.  I've paid $200 for Apple care and $100 twice to replace a screen.  We did NOTHING to the screen. no signs of abuse, a bump, a scratch, NOTHING. just open one day and the screen is black and pixelated. The break is internal. When its not broken, its a great computer.  Just be ready to buy it several times over replacing the screen.mIf you are already a victim, there are law firms taking cases.  Apple ought to step up and just deal with the defect.  Forcing customers that have been loyal to the brand to join in a class action suit in order to deal with the know and ongoing problem is awful.  Too bad they are so big they just don't care."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"Purchased this laptop in November (half a year ago) but did not really start using until the spring semester (end of January). About a month ago, I randomly opened my laptop to find colored lines across the screen. No damage to the phone as most my classes were remote and I was using my computer on my desk. It ended up going away on its own after shutting it down for 2 hours, but lines continue to reappear every few days or so then disappear after I let it rest. I looked it up online and it seems to be a hardware issue but I do not know how to fix this since I did not cause the problem. Never installed anything additional on my laptop besides google chrome and R software for research. Do not go through Amazon to purchase mac products."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"Overall, I love it. However, with that said there are some serious cons to consider before purchasing.1. Terrible camera--super grainy. This is unfortunate for a time that the majority of us are working at home or are reliant on FT for communication.2. It's important to be mindful, and as most techs will admit, this is easily apple's worst M chip--it will only get better! In the meantime, however, this Mac is super fast!I use it for school, work, and casual browsing. If that's what you're looking for, I recommend it. If you're looking for the best of the best, wait until they fix this camera."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"Junk.  For $1000, I'm gonna need a little more than a 256GB ssd that can't ever be upgraded or replaced because it's soldered to the MB.  When the SSD goes, the whole thing is worthless.  Or inversely, if the MB dies, you can't remove the drive to get your data.  It's like they are trying to fill up landfills with garbage on purpose."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,It amazes me how much praise Apple seems to be getting for an out dated design and user interface.  Where is the touch interface and pen input especially since it is supposed to run IPad apps?  Where is the flexibility of a 2 in 1 that we have had available for years?  Apple has basically given us a fast dinosaur with a pretty face.
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"Apple makes an incredible product. But their contempt for the customer knows no end. This is especially exemplified by the reduction of ports to only two on the MacBook Aires and even some Powerbooks. And EVERYTHING is put into those two. The separate power port is gone. The separate video out port is gone. In some cases, even the audio out port is gone. All they leave you with is two USB ports which they expect you to use for everything. For a lot of people, like myself, multiple ports are needed for constant use. They are needed for external hard drives (especially for file backup where you don't want to use the Apple Cloud which is susceptible to NSA snooping), external DVD and CD burners, special printers that do NOT work with Bluetooth, special mice for people like myself with handicaps that make trackpads difficult, drawing pads, etc. etc. etc. And don't tell me to just get an external hub. I have tried them all and NONE of them provide proper power to external tools that need it. Plus they frequently get hotter than a firecracker. In summation, Apple needs to start giving consideration to the Customer's needs and not just to some fancy ""updated"" technology. Bluetooth does not work dependably and is a real pain most of the time and is not available for all external tools. We NEED physical ports. Please put them back on the MacBooks, especially the ""Aires"". And stop taking them off of the Mac Cubes. The last one I bought had no audio port causing extreme problems with my video production work. PLEASE APPLE, BRING BACK THE PORTS. Otherwise I may be forced, God forbid, to go back to Microsoft computers."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"This was the first Apple Laptop I've purchased. My entire life I was so excited to always purchase an Apple MacBook/MacBook Air because of the positive reviews. I tend to review most everything in the most positive light, but this is just horrible. I constantly come back to the laptop and it says ""Please report unexpected shutdown to Apple."" This has happened at least 8 times with no response from an Apple Technician. Then the camera quality for a 2020 Machine is something out of the 1990s. It's horrible, I look grainy and I bought this laptop for an MBA program. If you want to run many programs at once, even with upgrade RAM and Processor, you will hear what sounds like an airplane trying to take off CONSTANTLY. The. fan. does. not. shut. off. Sure it's portable, sure the ""build"" quality feels good in the hand. In terms of performance, spend the extra money and don't get this. I'm quite embarrassed I shelled out over $1k for this. Do as you wish, but this laptop is not worth the money and has pretty much ruined my desire to get any form of an Apple Laptop again."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"I gave my wife this new MacBook Air as a gift 3 months ago. She is very careful with it. She opens it last night and the screen is garbled. There's a hairline crack in it leading from the left edge. It wasn't dropped. It wasn't pressed on, sat on, or kept under books. In other words it was NORMAL use when the damn thing stopped working.We took it to Apple store and they want $400+ to fix it. It's 3 months old! The guy says the display is flimsy and subject to crack. I go online to see if he is telling the truth... found a LOT of hits of others complaining about how easily the screen cracks.I'm a big Apple fan but am disappointed and outraged that Apple would sell a product with such a design flaw and expect users to ""buy Apple Care"" so that they pay ""less when it breaks""... even under NORMAL use.Save your money, buy and older model or get an iPad which ironically can take a beating by a 12 year old gamer without fail!"
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"I am one of the thousands that have come back to their laptop the next day only to find black vertical lines.  This has happened twice (I bought the computer in August 2021) .  Apple fixed the screen the first time, but are now asking for 514 dollars, claiming that I damanged the screen.  I did not!  This problem is so common there are two class action lawsuits that have been filed against Apple.  They purposely sold a computer that they knew would develop cracks with opening or closing it."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,First off I’m giving this one star just so you’ll read this honest review. I brought this Mac book and have been satisfied with functionality and speed but I’m giving 1 star because apple really nickel and dimes us as customers. The usb c cable that comes with the laptop is not even close to being one of the best on the market. I attempted to use it to power my elgato game capture card and the card would not read. Kept saying I need a usb3.0 to work. So I then used the cable that came with my Samsung external hard drive and bang it work immediately. I spent a lot of money on this laptop just to receive a weak cable with it. The cable is literally only good for charging and light duty file transfer which I guess is ok for most people. But for me it was not. Apple already doesn’t give us headphones anymore and they don’t even have the decency to give us a very good cable. 1star because for this price I could have built a computer or brought a prebuilt one. Last apple laptop I will ever buy. O and the camera sucks and there are no setting to adjust it.
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"Just bought the new M1 and through a series of events and customer support prompts: I started out with 2 computer's and can now barely use my old one because it's too old to support macOS Catalina  (mac pro late 2012)...super unhappy, not because the support wasn't excellent, because it was. Rather because I was sent a computer that didn't know how to migrate data from one mac to the next, which is fully unacceptable. Every prompt to fix this issue adds more time I've had to invest in this problem and ultimately makes things worse. I've been at fixing this issue since Tuesday. It would be fine if the process hadn't bricked my old computer where, once I was running logic, can now barely open a pdf. I've been thinking of moving out of the mac eco system for some time now and this will certainly push me on my way out of it. I've not had the new M1 computer for a week and haven't even seen the home screen yet. Every one says how awesome the M1 is, hopefully some day i'll know."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"Great out of the box, then slowly the battery life started decreasing, the constant hard reboots to get Safari back up and running, inexplicably running hot, and crashing more often than a Windows machine. Simply plugging in the power adapter is enough to crash the system followed by the necessary reboot.I firmly believe that Apple will eventually get the bugs will get worked out, but for now look elsewhere or wait for either the M1x or M2 processors that will hopefully have this operating smoothly.UPDATE: There are other emerging issues.In Safari, the keystrokes to italicize ""Command+I"" will randomly switch to opening up a new email message, and the keystrokes to convert text to LaTeX, ""command+shift+L"" now inexplicably opens the left panel. I am also coming into the known compatibility issue mentioned elsewhere."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"What happens when you perfect a product? You can only go downhill. In 2015 Apple perfected the MacBook. Then, they ruined it.Everyone in 2015: It's great. A bit more battery life would be nice.Apple: We'll make it thinner, make the touchpad so big people hit it with their palms, remove the magnetic break-a-way power cable that everyone loves, replace all the ports with USB-C ports so people have to buy dongles, swap the keyboard for one that barely even functions, and hell (just to mess with everyone) let's lower the battery life.The 2020 does little to fix any of the issues. It's a crap product, but after Jobs died Tim Cook couldn't make changes because he'd basically be admitting he was wrong. And they need to keep changing things because otherwise it is only perfect and not ""new"" - Whoever decided this was the way to go should be working in an Amazon warehouse sorting returns."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"My 2018 MBA died (logic board).  It was 2-1/2 years old.  Apple quoted $500 to repair it.  The repair came with a 90 day warranty.  They told me that if I had purchased Apple Care, it would have been covered.  If I had purchased Apple Care on all of the Apple computers I've purchased over the past 25 years I could have bought 2-3 brand new MacBook Airs.  Used to be a fan of Apple."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"Good speed, but have several issues with printer both Scan & print. Also I am facing issue with external drive back up.  There is no inbuilt flash drive port."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"Don't let the fanboys sway you, you're a beta tester with this laptop.  Lots of software doesn't function with it, I know, it didn't run of key programs I needed, also what does can be buggy at times.  If you're using this for work or real money is counting on its use DO NOT buy, simple as that.  Lots of things should have been better, the bezel in 2021 is thick.  The lack of ports is ridiculous.  If you planned to use windows, count that out.  If your a grandma using it to surf the web go for it."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"I've had mine less than 3 months and am unhappy and peeved off. While this is a pretty and nice laptop as well as light and easy to travel with. It LAGS and is SLOW. Every time I haven't opened my laptop an hour after I last opened it nothing happens with the screen and I am forced to hold the power button until it turns off and then on again, if I'm lucky it works the first time. and when you plug anything into it the computer FREEZES! (you also need to get an adapter because it doesn't take USB) Apple is once again charging way too much for a subpar product. If you're looking for fast and streamlined this is NOT the computer for you. Very disappointed and utterly annoyed."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"Like thousands of other people, the screen started flickering after about 2 months. Then it went completly black. Apple store said my only option was pay over $400 to fix the screen. Apple call center said they can only take a complaint and my only option is to pay the money the store said to fix their defective product. Google to find out more. Don't by this defective product, Apple says it is not covered by its warranty because it is the customer fault. But, it is happening to 1000s of people and they know it is actually their fault."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"Liked:- Long battery life (one charge WILL last all day, i.e. 16 hours. Personally tested true)- Speed (the new M1 processor really is fast)- Quiet (no fan but the laptop still does not get hot)- Light and portable- High resolution & bright displayDisliked:- As with other MacBooks, the keyboard is mediocre especially compared to laptops like Lenovo Thinkpad- Incompatible applications (With the M1 processor still being new, you might experience existing programs frequently crash. For example, Chrome keeps crashing) But I would guess there will be a fix soon"
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"This is one of the most expesive laptops and have not Microsoft pack.  Pages &numbers, is horrible to work in it.You need to buy the New Microsoft pack becasue it does not includying it and worse do not let dowlond due the M1 card, I do not find nothing good different neither in the camera with this new macbook air 2020.  At the least my last macbook air had inclided the Microsoft pack and was more easy to work.  The screen is not different neither with my old macbook, so I am vert disssapoinment, I bougth in January 2021 directly from the Apple website."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,Bought one directly from Apple. I was excited to see how nice it would be to use since I had recently moved over to using an iPhone and was impressed at how it had improved over the years. All the positive reviews and videos everywhere made this seem like a great product. Don’t be fooled. Please. This is one of the most disappointing and frustrating pieces of tech I’ve ever had the displeasure of getting to use. Never have I seen or used a computer that had so many options that you will never need. Missing options you should always have. And not be capable of preforming basic tasks without bugging out. To those saying this is one of the best computers you’ve ever used… have you ever used a computer before? Anytime within the last 10-15 years? I’m willing to bet not.
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"It's 2021 and Apple is STILL ripping it's customers off by only including 8 GB's of RAM as the standard configuration.  Even worse is they rip you off again if you purchase this item with 16 GB's of RAM, which is what it should have in the first place!  And of course, there's not an option for a user upgrade.  Ridiculous for the price they charge for their laptops!!"
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"Just as I bought a 2nd M1 Macbook Air... The first one, which I'm currently using to make this review, randomly freezes and then automatically reboots itself after seeing a pink screen. Doing a quick search, you can find ARTICLES about this issue that isn't being fixed with software updates. This must be a hardware issue... God I hope they didn't cheap out again."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"UPDATE 12-15-2020 - After three weeks, I'm still really impressed with the M1 MacBook Air/8 Core CPU/8 Core GPU/512 SSD/8GB RAM. --- My updated plea: MAKE SURE YOU GET AS MUCH MEMORY & STORAGE AS YOU CAN AFFORD. SPECIAL ORDER ONE TO YOUR PROJECTED FUTURE NEED!Remember, Macs live a very long time and the value it holds will depend on how usable it will be to you or someone else in 5 or even 10 years. Not that long ago, 80 GB hard drives were HUGE... and UPGRADABLE. RAM was upgradable. The SSD and the RAM in these machines is NOT upgradable.The one issue for me has been that I am a memory hog! I tend to have LOTS of tabs open at once (I've caught myself with 50 (Safari) open in one browser and 39 (Chrome) in another!), while running Affinity/Final Cut Pro - and YES, the dreaded Beach Ball has reared it's ugly head. Well, this got me to assess what I will be using the machine for and for how long.Storage can be added with external drives, slower, but it will let you scrape by. RAM is another story. When you constantly use up RAM, the system starts using ""swap memory"" where it uses the SSD to store temporary files. One of the YouTube reviewers (Created Labs) explains it like this: RAM memory is like writing on a white board, it's made to be temporary. Writing to the SSD is like writing on paper with a pencil. It can be erased, but if it's written on and erased for too long, it's going to degrade the medium. It will take years for this to cause problems, but keep in mind that in these M1 MacBooks, none of the parts are replaceable. The SSD and the RAM are soldered onto the board.***As ridiculously expensive as Apple RAM is, when it's not upgradable, get the maximum, in this case, 16 GB.I really doubt that Apple will be making machines with user upgradable RAM after the switch from Intel is complete, except for possibly the very high end Pro models.There is also the fact that if I am going to be doing a decent amount of video editing, a M1 with a fan will be helpful. Upgrading to the cheaper ($699+Upgrades) M1 Mac mini would be the cheapest way to get better performance for the Pro Apps, but I need a laptop, so... So, that is why I'm planning to return this machine and get one (likely the MacBook Pro M1), with 16 GB RAM & 1 TB SSD.***A note on browsers, Safari is by far the BEST browser to run on the M1, at least for now. I always had issues with saving web pages as PDF files in Chrome, where it did not save most of the images/text on the page. In Safari, it's worked perfectly.------I purchased the MacBook Air M1, 8 core GPU, and 8 core CPU model, with 512 GB SSD and 8 GB RAM in person at the Apple Store (11-20-2020), with education pricing. I traded in my (MNYH2LL/A) - 2017 12"" Macbook with the Intel M3 processor, 256 GB SSD, 8 GB Ram. I kept my charging adapter & C-cable (which are both compatible with the M1 Late 2020 Macbook Air), so ended up with a $330 Apple Store instant credit towards the M1.The M1 model has blown me away with its speed and smooth running with a large number of apps open, including Final Cut & Logic Pro. Admittedly the 2017 MB was the bottom of the line and I suffered under frequent overheating issues with too many things open and the single C-port fiasco.I likely would have gone with the 7 core GPU model if one had been in stock at the time of purchase, but I wanted 512 GB of SSD space, so I paid more by going with eh 8 core. From everything that I've seen, the lack of more RAM upgrades is not nearly as important as it was with the Intel x86 processors and is really only useful when you have many GPU intensive ""Pro Apps"" running at the same time.I would never have dreamed of running Final Cut or Logic Pro on the 2017 Macbook, so this has been an amazing upgrade for me.I would say that the bottom line is that if you're someone who only uses a laptop for office & basic web surfing and only has a few tabs open at once, and you never experience overheating or the dreaded beach ball ""not responding"" issues, or if you have non-Apple programs that have not been compiled for the M1 chip, hold off on the upgrade until more apps run natively on the M1. If however, you really need a machine that is MUCH more capable, faster and cooler running than the Intel models, it's a solid buy and an amazing upgrade from any non-upgradable Mac."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,I'm a fan of apple products and I like almost everything about this new MBA. But it has one huge flaw that nobody talks about. It's the camera hardware and it hasn't been updated in ages. My zoom calls are so grainy and bad even with decent light. A $1000 laptop with 10 year old front camera is unacceptable. Camera is very important to me. Especially now that we all are quarantined at home and making zoom calls all the time.
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"Buyer beware! Like the MacBook Pro pictured here, the screen of the MacBook Air often cracks within a few weeks or months after purchase, entirely without any misuse. The design flaw seems to be the relative inflexibility of the screen's LCD panel.I ordered a MBA, then returned the package unopened after reading relevant articles on 9to5mac and the discussion thread on the Apple support site. With few exceptions, Apple refuses to make the repair under warranty. The user's cost of replacing the screen amounts to half the purchase price."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,I have big hands. This computer was not made for anyone who has large hands. My hands cramp constant as i type and i cannot get a bigger/better computer because of how much i have already spent. It is extremely frustrating. It is so small. I mistype constantly and have accidentally deleted many important things!!! This computer also glitches ALOT. It is constantly changing my mouse from “single click” to “double” . It constantly opens new tabs and new pages for no reason. Waste of money. Just buy a pc. I am regretful
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,I've tried several wireless mouse and flash drive neither will connect to device.
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,Be aware the screen is extremely delicate and prone to break for no apparent reason. Apple won't acknowledge the design fault and now there is a class action law suite. Stay away from the AIR unless you enjoy expensive repair bills.
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"Theres a serious glitch where you can't use touch ID if drained from dead battery. Then it will ask you for a password. Unclear if this is an apple ID password or whatever, but mine didn't work. Tried every combo I knew. And then there is no option for reset password. Just none at all. And then it won't enter recovery mode. Just a horrible product, stay far away"
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"Dropped about $2500 on 3 of these roughly 3 years ago.  One had battery issues, one had logic board failure which Apple would not cover, and 3rd is doing fine.  Apple has kept up with design quality, camera is top notch, but does not meet quality expectations overall.  With the reduced cost of Windows machines, may be time to step out of my Apple bubble."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,Do not buy refurbished/ used laptops from Amazon. Often times they are stolen and when you need software upgraded or fixed the manufacturer will not touch the computer when they figure out its stolen. Amazon will not refund or replace the computer with one that is not stolen. So you are stuck with stolen goods that can not be repaired through the manufacturer
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"Don't be fulled by 13"" description. Its bigger! And much heavier! New Air completely lost its purpose to be small and light laptop that is convenient on the go. If I wanted a bigger and more capable laptop I would have bought a PRO not an AIR. PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE make a normal size AIR"
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"Bad Apple! Battery always drop dead without any reason. Sometimes, it is still 90% of battery, but it dropped dead in the middle of nowhere, or freeze, the screen just freezes 10 times a day at least. I have to force it to power off and on 10 times a day at least. I only have the Mac Air for 3+ Years, totally a junk!"
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,Why doesn't the warranty option appear anywhere on the page rendering the new MacBook Air (M1) - even if I put it in my cart... there's no checkbox rendering for Apple's warranty?
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,They really should issue a recall on this particular model. The screen cracks on its own and yet Apple denies there is an issue. Going to be exchanging this for an older model that at least will last.
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,I cannot believe how bad this camera is on the so-called sophisticated Apple product? And no USB ports - how ridiculous  is that? So if you want to use an external mouse you can’t do that - I could go on!
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"If you are planning on using a dock/dongle with this, you might want to wait. Having TONS of issues with USB not working via dock/dongle. Has happened with a few different brand/models of docks/dongles. Very frustrating and Mac forums/Apple customer service have been no help so far."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,GRAINY UNUSABLE CAMERA. DO NOT BUY THIS LAPTOP. OR ANY LATEST 2020 MODEL - APPLE REFUSES TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE ISSUE. WHAT A DISGRACE FOR A COMPANY LIKE APPLE CUSTOMER SERVICE TO REFUSE TO ACCEPT THE FLAW.
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,See above
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,cant seem to find a case that will fit the bottom of my new m1 macbook air
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"I've had a variety of Apple equipment in my life-- but also Microsoft Surface, Surface Laptops, Chromebooks, and more. I'm an open minded technology user and tend to go with best of breed or technology that pushes the envelope of what is possible. I like well designed hardware that looks and feels good, and works well.I bought this one open box, that shouldn't matter at all, and it doesn't. It arrived from Amazon Warehouse Deals as ""like new"" condition with ""like new box"" and the unit had no scratches/scrapes on it and was missing 3 months of warranty-- I'm happy to have the remainder.The latest Macbook I had was the 12"" Macbook from several years back. It was quite nice but was too small for me. This one has continued to improve on the screen, battery life and CERTAINLY has improved on the performance front.The unit is thin, svelte, and HEAVY. I mean, it could be a solid block of metal and I would expect the same heft. It's solid. This is not a bad thing for a device that is this thin & small to add some durability to what could otherwise be a very delicate device.The keyboard is very solid with a nice clickety-click, I am not able to tell a difference from this keyboard to the generations that were rather ""controversial"" and I very much do appreciate the touch ID in the power button.Having two USB-C ports is very welcomed compared to my previous which had only one.When looking at the performance of the M1 chip and all previous models, especially the 12"" Macbook, and comparing to the prices those still sell for, it was a no brainer to go with this model. Even compared to the Macbook Pro M1, there is a very slight difference between the two and for a rather light user the cost here was really an incredible value.I love Windows for some things. I have Windows running on this unit as well with Parallels-- easy and simple-- do note you will need to download ARM Windows 10 media for this unit-- I was not able to find a way to migrate my previous VM from Intel based.  It runs very well here and with no issues. Very fast.One thing that didn't work great for me-- maybe it's me-- maybe it's Mac OS-- was plugging it in to a USB-C dock. I have a standard setup at home with 3 monitors, USB based external bose speakers, keyboard, mouse, and typically as I cycle through Chromebooks and Windows devices, I'm able to plug in and fairly easily extend / activate those monitors, use the peripherals and printer/etc. In this case I haven't had success getting this Mac to work with my USB-C based dock and accessories-- to be determined.The screen is beautiful, the hardware is unbelievably solid, the speed is amazing.  I also have a Surface Laptop that I love, but for the Mac variety, this is my perfect equivalent."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"I was looking to upgrade from my current dual core intel i7 Windows laptop and tablet. The 2020 MacBook Air M1 screen is sharp, the M1 processor performance is similar to intel i7 quad core for most uses . This laptop is fan-less and gets very warm/hot only when constantly exporting very large 5Gb+ files - otherwise it runs cool to cold. I edit photos on this laptop and my editing software opens much faster and the edits occur very quickly. The 8Gb ram/256 Gb ssd combo in this laptop is fast and responsive. The Mac OS memory management allows 8Gb to be more than enough for my projects. The M1 cpu performance and battery life for the MacBook Air M1 easily exceed those of my dual core i7 Windows laptop and tablet. My photo editing software runs faster and is more responsive than on my Windows devices. Also, the MacBook Air M1 performance seems the same whether on battery or ac power unlike my Windows devices. This laptop is a fantastic entry-level device but hard core gamers and video creators should upgrade to the Pro models for the larger/more vibrant screen, richer audio, cooling fans, additional usb-c ports, sd card slot, dual monitor capability, and more ram/ssd options. I purchased this used base model used at a substantial savings over the list price which made it a fantastic value. I would suggest most users get the 512Gb or larger internal ssd so you won't need an external ssd for video/music storage. I currently use external ssd drives to store my large files so the small 256Gb ssd size in the base model was not an issue. The only possible drawbacks for the MacBook Air are there are only 2 usb-c data/charging ports so you may need to purchase a dock if you need multiple connection options, (or use older usb accessories), there is no sd card slot, and software apps are still being updated for the M1 cpu. I run Microsoft Office 365 on my MacBook Air. I notice that Office 365 takes a second or two longer to load but once loaded Office 365 runs as fast as it does on Windows.  I don't use this laptop for gaming, video editing, or to connect multiple monitors so I can't comment on those uses. I was not expecting this level of performance from an entry-level device. Don't get caught up in the hype that this base model can replace the MacBook Pro models for heavy work loads or professional use - it doesn't have the heat distribution (fans) to dissipate the heat to prevent thermal throttling under heavy computing or gaming. For most users, just use and enjoy your 2020 MacBook Air M1!!"
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"First time Macbook owner. Really happy with the MacBook Air. Don't let the lack of a fan be off-putting. The only time it gets even remotely warm is when rendering a video in iMovie. Even then, it's by no means hot to the touch. This is probably the most fail proof laptop out right now and dare I say, ever. The lack of a fan eliminates the last mechanical part and means this laptop have no moving parts. The soldered in m.2 storage and committing to your RAM choice for the life of the laptop is my only complaint. So far I'm not finding 8gb of RAM to be an issue. Most of the programs for Mac OS are pretty well optimized for the M1 chip. So Everything feels to work pretty smoothly. The battery life is next level. Over all it's more powerful, cooler and the battery lasts longer than ever. If you have been wanting to get your first MacBook or have been batting around the idea of an upgrade. This would not be a bad choice."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"The device is silent because it has no fans, the screen isn't Oled but it looks incredible for watching movies with vibrant colors and is very sharp making it great for text documents with small fonts. The battery life is incredibly good I can constantly get over a day with moderate to high use and yet somehow still manages to be an incredibly light device. It has a good dac and plenty of volume making it a good choice for audio lovers, especially if you use open backs since it makes no noise, and if you don't use headphones the speakers can get very loud and sound really good for a laptop. It runs mac OS which can be hard to adapt too but it is alot less power intensive than windows so you rarely have to worry about overheating or battery in daily use. If you are a professional video or photo editor or run intensive task look towards a pro computer and for everyone else this is a great choice."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"This is the bargain deal of the Apple lineup at the moment. The M1 chip gives it crazy power management which equates to ridiculously long battery life, incredibly low temperature operation which needs no fan so also absolute silence. All this while running circles around the competitors offerings which don’t stand a chance of keeping up with this incredible product. With their M1 chip Apple has not just revolutionized the capabilities of a laptop but turned the whole computer industry upside down! And yes it is extremely well made out of a solid chunk of aluminum, is very light and has a world class screen and a redesigned keyboard that feels wonderful. Incase you couldn’t tell I like and recommend this laptop!"
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,My first day. I’ve used MacBooks since 2006 when the first Intel processors were used. The M1 chip is amazing. I now understand why 8 Gb of RAM is perfect for this model. Crystal clear text rendering. Silky-smooth touch pad. Nice tactile response on keyboard— big improvement over the troublesome keyboards of the last 7 years. Speakers are lovely. Very pleased. Battery fully charged. Was able to easily migrate from my old 2016 MacBook Retina 12. Easy to connect with iCloud and Mac account. A couple of my non-Apple apps required Rosetta to run with M1 processor—smooth download of Rosetta. Anyone needing a high end camera might go for the MacBook Pro but this is fine for my needs.
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,Purchased for my daughter in college and she loves it. She used one before and knew exactly what she wanted for a college digital graphing classes
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"I bought my first Mac in 1986 and my first 100 shares of Apple in 1992. No one could have dreamed what Apple was to become. And I never believed that I'd get a job working for Apple, and add to those shares over the next 14 years through the employee stock ownership program. Every 3 months, I get a dividend that's 4 times what I originally paid for those 100 shares, which have now become 6428 shares through reinvesting those dividends.Which brings me to this review: The reason Apple is approaching a 3 trillion dollar market cap is because they make the greatest products in the world, and everyone wants them. And I'm writing this on the laptop in my review, and it's just an unbelievable value!"
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"Arrived quickly packed in harder-than-normal, fitted cardboard box...that was inside another box containing a coat we ordered. (Excellent packing). Waited to unpack it until new cover/screen & keyboard protectors arrived. This is the first Mac I have bought online and the migration looked easy. But it hasn't worked. I've taken down(and since put back up) the firewalls on both new and old laptops, as advised, but  it never did migrate. But signing into everything Apple was easy and I LOVE having finger ID...I'm also looking forward to better battery life and appreciate a slightly larger screen. Great discount. Husband gave me a new iPad in September and I'm anxious to see how I can use that as a secondary screen with MacBook Air."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"I needed a fast little laptop, something light, that could work with my Cricut machine, watch streaming shows, research for my book, write my book, play some games on, and not take 20 minutes to load. This does all that, and apparently it has a touch screen! I didn't rate it because I haven't used it! That aside, it's fast, boots right up, runs my Cricut through Bluetooth,  is small and light, and I love it! The only thing is that so much still comes with a regular USB plug and I just had to buy an adapter to go from reg USB to a USB C. Anyway, love it!"
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"I’ve read amazing things about Apple’s new chips but I was still blown away by how well everything worked.  Zero fan noise (possibly zero fan, period), can play all the games I care about (Factorio/FTL/Rimworld/LoL/FFXIV), and everything is snappy as hell. I even bought a Windows Laptop for the same price to compare it to and there was no contest.  Even at $1000 the windows laptop constantly felt cheap, loud, and underpowered.  Needless to say I returned the Windows Laptop and have been enjoying the MacBook Air ever since."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"I am nearly 60 and have never had a Mac.  A friend of mine talked me into it, and I love it.  It is not only user friendly but Apple offers ongoing expert customer support for ANY question or tech issue you have.  I am not tech savvy and these people are miracle workers, able even to straighten me out quickly every time I call.  Love the unit and love customer support both."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,this is my first mac although I have had my iphone for a couple years. This mac was a piece of cake to set up.love it
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"This laptop si so light and powerful, hard to believe is something like this on the market. With fan free technology you have no noise as well nothing hot anymore under your keyboard.My daughter loves it. Battery is very good si lasting more than 8 hours. She is using it daily at HS and at home. This is a great laptop for the price."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,I use this for college and it is great! It was really difficult to learn how to use. It is so different from an IPhone. But it loads quick and is beautiful. It picks up finger prints more than your phone does and you can really see them too so make sure to wash your screen but besides that it is amazing! Especially for the price I got it for of $850!
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"This is one of the best purchases I have ever made. I truly love it, and believe it is the best air ever made. No plans to upgrade anytime Sumer. Truly revolutionary in the laptop genre. Cheers Apple!"
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,I needed to upgrade my old desk top computer and synch it with my iPhone.  Perfection.  Everything about Apple is the best and this MacBook Air is delightful.  There is so much more I can do and I can see the possibilities are endless.
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"This is a phenomenal laptop and not just at its price point. The M1 chip is snappy and fast, the battery life is amazing and the screen quality is excellent. All of that is bundled in a thin, light and quiet (fan-less) form factor. I’d highly recommend this MacBook Air unless you want to run high intensity games (they just aren’t native to Mac OS and won’t run as well as they will on Windows)."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,Its cool. Running Zwift just fine after downloading rosetta. I push through an older 780p projector and i have the apple adapter for hdmi (non 4k) …and its crisp enough for me at this point. Opted for the rose gold and it really added a special tone to the notebook. Im happy with it self updating too. The fingerprint button is a big easy too. I think I’ll keep it.
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"Not much to say here that’s different from what’s been said elsewhere. Build quality on point per usual with Apple. Feels as slick as ever. No problems thus far about app compatibility with the M1 chip. As with almost all apple products, you can purchase with your eyes closed."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"I’ve wanted a MacBook for the longest time, and Amazon surprised me having the cheapest option for buying this one! So I finally took the plunge. I’m upgrading from a very tired HP. Never having experience with MacBook before, I’m in love with it. It’s awesome how much you can personalize this little laptop. Lighting fast, too. Getting to know the touch pad and all the little features is mind boggling in the best way."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"I love my mac. Works perfectly, very fast and the battery life is sooo long.  I use it every day for more than half the day and I only have to charge it about 1 or twice a week! I really recommend.  The touch ID is awesome too."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,So I hesitated to buy this computer thinking I wouldn't use it enough to justify the price. I absolutely love it! Granted I just use it to surf and shop but it is so user friendly and the keyboard is awesome! I'm really glad I bought it and I use it every day.
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,This is my first Apple laptop and I LOVE IT.  It is so quick and easy to use.  There is a learning curve but luckily I have my kids.
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"This is the first Mac I have owned, I'll never go back to pc's!! very fast and super easy to use. it works with all my Apple electronics. I haven't played any games on it yet so I couldn't give it any stars yet, also it has stars for touch screen which this model doesn't have, it has the Touch ID."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"My first Mac after years of Linux. I couldn't be more impressed. I'm amazed at what this machine can do with only 8GB RAM. I always have a dozen+ browser tabs, multiple VSCode windows, Xcode, and countless other programs open, and this thing never gets bogged down. I'm a total convert!"
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"Excelente producto, batería alcanza para una jornada de trabajo de oficina promedio.  Calidad del material excelente.  En general es un gran producto y sobre todo que su vida útil es mínimo de unos 5 años."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,I play the sims all the time on it now. I can also get my work and homework done. This is a great laptop. It costly but it's worth the money.
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"It’s simple , clean aesthetically, and really powerful compared to older models . The m1 chip has really put this laptop on another level. Easy to carry and can handle simple and even hard tasks ."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"Apple doesn’t offer touch screen laptops.  Description is missleading as it does describe touch screen capabilities. In actuality it applies to touch screen ID, the little square black button at the top right of the keyboard.  First time apple laptop user."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,I called Geek Squad and they could not fix the problem.  Unfortunately I had to return the wildly anticipated Macbook Air. So disappointing.
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"Replaced a previous MacBook Air with the new version. Same sleek design, upgraded performance. The computer is quick and easy to use. Plus it is lighter than the 2011 version I replaced."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,This has everything I could possibly want in a laptop and more! I love being able to use my fingerprint to access my laptop! It is thin and light for easy portability as well! Definitely recommend!
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"Been wanting a MacBook for a decade-I love this one! I thought rose gold was discontinued in this model, but mine was rose gold -Love it!"
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"This is my first Mac ever. I had to go through a small learning curve to get used to the OS and the keyboard layout and shortcuts. But now I am so happy with the purchase.Really good screen, trackpad and keyboard. Amazing battery life. So compact and light. The only thing that I miss from my previous laptop is a touchscreen.I would without any hesitation recommend this for anyone looking for a handy and powerful laptop."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"This is the first time I have used a Mac product for an extended period of time. I have owned it for a couple months now and must admit I am very happy with how well it performs. My apprehension at buying a Mac product was in getting used to the OS, as it is considerably different from Windows. However it did not take long for me to get used to macOS, it was easy to learn and use, with much better organization than Windows."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"I’m in school and this computer is fabulous. I can’t attest to gaming, but it does wonderfully with papers, speed, social media, zoom and webex meetings, and messing around on the cricut."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,Great laptop! My daughter loves it. Awesome purchase and nicely packaged for care.
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"Just a heads up- the item is rose gold, not gold.  I'm actually happy that it's rose versus yellow gold."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"I purchased this at the beginning of March, and for the past month, I have found out that this has been really efficient for me. I have been able to use this laptop for multiple school purposes and even stream movies and tv shows which has been really nice for me. The battery efficiency is also really nice I must add."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"I don't get the hype about M1 chip. Half of my programs aren't compatible with it and some aren't updated anymore so there is a little hope for a fix. The camera is horrible as well, picture quality is worse then what my 3 years old smartphone produces"
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"Got this for my daughter for college, she loves it"
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,The computer would start up quickly and battery last a long time. It is a great computer.
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"The media could not be loaded.
                



 It was very nice 😍 good price I got it on Christmas and Amazon dealAwesome sauce"
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"Apple notebooks are great and work smoothly, however it is inconceivable that such an expensive and top machine does not support 2 external monitors such as the previous macbookair with intel chip does.On top of that there are only 2 USB C ports, so that any additional connection must come with expensive connectors."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"it’s thin not too heavy a nice sleek look is the perfect laptop for school, really fast and overall great quality. my only complaint is the camera terrible quality but i don’t really use the camera overall a 9/10 connects to iphone and u can see ur messages"

Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,Efectiva
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"IntroAs a college student, having a reliable and portable workstation is extremely valuable. The New MacBook Air powered by the M1 chip is one of the most exciting devices recently released by Apple. Although it looks just like the previous models, the M1 chip delivers insanely great performance.Design and buildSince its inception, Macbook Air’s design and build were one of its core selling points, and the Macbook Air M1 is no exception. It has that Signature Aluminium body that you’ll see with the other Macbook Variants. The laptop not only looks premium but it definitely feels like your money’s worth. You can easily open this laptop with only one finger, this is possible because of the incredibly engineered hinge design done by apple. One of the things that the original Macbook air lacked for a while was a decent display, gone are the days of a 720p panel. And brought is a beautiful P3 Wide color gamut 2560*1440p panel, The overall viewing experience is awesome! The bezels are the same size as last year's model, which was kinda disappointing when compared to other laptops recently released, but it's not something that will ruin the overall viewing experience. The updated magic keyboard has better travel and also the gigantic mouse pad is always a blessing, I’m yet to find a trackpad on a laptop that I like better than the ones made by apple. The dual speaker grills on this laptop produce pretty decent sound, however, there is some slight distortion at high volumes.StorageStorage is also very important as a college student. As you're going to need some space to store all your documents, files, and Zoom Lectures. The MacBook Air comes with up to 2TB of SSD storage. This specific model I have only had 128GB of storage which honestly should be fine for most students, and if you don’t want to spend a lot of money you can always buy an external SSD or hard drive. This will cost you way less than what Apple offers.PortabilityAs a College student in 2021, because of Covid, it's been kinda different, (Very small pause)all of our classes nowadays are held on zoom or some other online platform. So if you wanna use this laptop outside of a typical campus setting, then portability starts to matter. The MacBook Air weighs in at 2.75 pounds and is 15.6mm thick. This laptop will easily fit in most backups without feeling a noticeable weight difference. This is important to a lot of students, especially if you have back-to-back classes keeping in mind the average textbook weighs just over 4.6 pounds. This Laptop also easily fits in most handbags for women who were wondering.Reliability and BatteryThe Apple MacBook Air has proven itself as one of the most reliable laptops for a student this past decade. The Macbook Air is going to be a more compelling laptop for the students this, because of its insanely reliable performance for its price, but let's talk about the chip that’s made all this possible.The biggest change this year is no doubt the M1 chip, the ARM-based chip is fast,  like stupid fast. Applications open up real quick and the performance is consistently reliable. Not only can it easily fly through day-to-day tasks like browsing the internet and typing research papers, but it can also handle intensive tasks such as 4K video editing, in fact, I managed to edit an entire 4K video on the M1 MacBook air and the performance & exporting times were very impressive. Anyway, that was sometimes impossible on the previous-gens of Macbook air. Now if you are considering this device for video editing then I would highly recommend the 16 Gig variant.The next best thing aside from its insane performance is the incredible battery life, I think this is the best battery life I have ever seen on a laptop of this form factor. The laptop lasted me multiple days of light usage with the usual workload being typing, browsing, and streaming content. I can pull a full day of heavy usage with tasks like editing photos and videos.ConclusionOverall there’s a quote that says, “Speed is irrelevant if you are going in the wrong direction”. (Mahatma Gandhi). The Macbook Air M1 has set a new benchmark for consistent performance and delivers insanely awesome battery life which makes the overall experience pretty fire. Its Portability, reliability, and speed not only make this a great investment for a student but also for anybody who’s always on the go, and I’m personally really excited for the direction that Apple is heading towards with their new M lineup of processers."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"No problems with the mac air. Easy to transition from my old 2104 MacBook Pro. I also bought an external HD which was cheaper than upgrading from old 256 to 512. My warning is about Office 2019. There was stuff on the web that 2016 would not work, needed 64bit, but while there seemed to be workarounds, I just upgraded and bought 2019. There is a scam site posing as Microsoft Office/setup that looks legit once on it, but you get an error message and phone number to resolve. After half an hour he explains that it is the firewall and can fix it by downloading one costing only hundreds of dollars. The url isn't Microsoft but rest looks like it. While I didn't fall for it, it is preying on the few who might. So thought I would mention it. The mac is good and worth upgrading especially if, as with mine, hardware faults are developing in old one."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,I JUST GOT IT TODAY I MADE THE RIGHT DECISION ORDERING IT HERE. I HAVE NO ISSUE BOUT IT AT ALL I GAVE IT 4 STARS BECAUSE THERE IS A TINY DENT NOT A BIG DEAL.
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,i love it! i’ve had it for about 2 weeks now and it’s the best laptop i’ve ever owned. i do play games on it (mainly sims) and it doesn’t lag or mess up which i’m happy with. great buy and i’m happy i bought it!
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"Great product, fast and durable. Exactly what I expected."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"For the price, this recent M1Air is on a different planet regarding performance.  More ports would be nice, but it's a MacBook Air."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,I really liked this laptop - it has all I needed! Really appreciate the really good packaging and on-time arrival. It is also working very fast.
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,Still learning some of the new features. Not sure if I like it better than the MacBook Pro. It is slow to come on at times and sometimes has to be fiddled with to get it to come on. Screen quality is good and speed is improved. Touch sensitive keys are taking some getting used to.
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,Hey it’s an Apple product so it’s made well and is quality!
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"I'm new to the Mac world, at least since the early days in the 80s. So far it has been a pleasant experience and I like the stock software and layout. I haven't really had to purchase any additional apps to be able to do the things that I've become accustomed to on PCs, so there is a nice learning curve. I do have a couple of constructive criticisms, that are not specific to the MacBook Air, though. In the future, I'd like to see touchscreens included on their laptop models (being a former teacher of persons with autism, they really benefit from the additional input method). Also, the Retina display is awesome, but maybe in some of their higher priced laptops like the MacBook Pro they can start using OLEDs as model upgrades. Other than that I'm a fully satisfied Mac devotee now (though I still love my PCs)!"
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"The return policy at Amazon is even better than the one at the Apple store, the price is better too.Machine is much lighter than MacBook Pro but just as good at a better price point. A great introduction to the world of Mac laptops."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,The first one I received got bricked trying to restore after the initial setup failed.The second one is fine.You can google the issues.Apple support said I'd need to bring the first one into the apple store for a firmware update to get it working.Not great for a brand new 1000$ laptop.Anyway the second one came already updated and everything has been fine so I'm happy now.It's snappy and has that new macbook smell.
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,Really nice upgrade. Long battery life and completely silent. It also of course integrates with iPhone extremely well.
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,So far - I like everything about this laptop.
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,It’s just overpriced for what it is. An equivalent windows computer is $400 cheaper with the same specs and functionality.
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"I have purchased at amazon many times, I am satisfied with all products, about this macbbok air m1 works very well and the price is very good, I think I should hurry to own it, this can also be a gift."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"First new computer since 2011. Replaced an old iMac with this. Blazing fast, bright graphics, responds well, well built. And a fantastic value. With 256G of storage, it cost the same as the new Apple Watch Ultra."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"When has an apple product ever done anyone wrong. They are known for their reputation, and this is no exception. Obviously reliable, great battery life, stunning pixelation, and works well for remote working."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,Really nice upgrade. Long battery life and completely silent. It also of course integrates with iPhone extremely well.
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"I love it!! It has touch unlock, is not touch screen. Keyboard alga’s a great feel. Very nice"
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,Great deal on this and works phenomenally
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"Very sleek and the color is beautiful. I like the processor in the laptop and rarely have any issues. Sometimes the screen will get stuck if I click on something with a right click and I have to restart the computer to fix the issue, but this is on a very rare occasion. They keys are flat and spaced far apart enough that I can type quickly and hit the right key *almost* every time."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,This is just the update I needed for school and my graphic/marketing job. Lightweight and perfect to travel with.
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"It's just amazing !! this one with the m1 chip is a game changing , but i highly recommend to get the extra storage and the 16 gb ram i mean am not saying that the 8 gb ram won't work but i highly recommend to get the 16 gb ram if you're looking to run multiple tasks on this MacBook or playing games from steam ."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,Thank you
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"an excellent option, for work, have some problem with docker!! (for developers guys) the rest all very well, the screen, and the sound, and options are good, we only recommend a base for MacBook, for some heat in the down of the laptop, but I think is because don't have Forced ventilation for the Processor."

Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,Thank you
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,I can move it and use it everywhere.
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,Very good for college use and compact but big enough to do the job!
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,This was a great price for this speed demon.
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,Got to replace old MacBook Pro.  Getting too old and operating system out of date so had to move on.  Works great.
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,Changed from my MBP2017 to this one. Portable with strong functions.
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,I would buy it again. I’ve been a PC owner all my life and thus is my first Mac. I think I will stick with it.Update:  after trying this Mac for a year I gave up. As a lifelong Microsoft user I just could not make the switch and I bought an inexpensive PC which I use a lot more than I ever used the Mac.  The biggest hurdles were the hot buttons and incompatibility of spreadsheet and word documents. Nobody else seemed to be able to open them. The only way was to export to Excel or Word before sending them out and this resulted in a lot of versions of the same documents. Also the file manager was too hard to get used to send did not easily manage photos. I’m not changing the rating because lifelong Mac users would probably have the same problem in reverse.
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,It’s a really good laptop really happy with it
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,Everything I need for a great price in a apple laptop
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,Good buy
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"This laptop is very good for students and people wanting to do basic work as well as people who are going to have this laptop under EXTREME loads. I've ran heavy games and video editors and its done amazing! it's even beat some of my other $8,000 MacBooks! It's very light weight ( 2.8 pounds ) and is very thin but yet durable. It doesn't feel cheap like some laptops at this price point, It feels very premium with the metal body and soft keys and the retina display. The track pad is VERY large for the size of this laptop. I also love how it's fan-less so it never makes any noise which is another reason why it's good for students. ( video calls, etc. ) My one and only complaint is the camera quality. It looks nice if you have good lighting but if you're in bad lighting it looks like a potato filming. But if you can get passed that it's great. I also love how the keyboard is backlit, it helps a lot if you're in a dark environment. The screen is also very good, it's nice and bright and has amazing colors which is very good for photo editing! The package even came several days early and shipped very fast! Although the costumer service isn't very good. they didn't answer the questions I messages them about. ( I'll try to answer some questions I had ) It does come sealed in the original Apple packaging and it does have the M1 chip. All around I highly recommend this. It's amazing for the price tag."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,Great product for what's it's purpose.
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,Love Macbook Air with M1. Opened it and it was ready to go!!! I love Apple products.
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,I am very pleased to have my new iPad.Great to have!!
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,I love my computer
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,It's a very good laptop to get.
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,Performance is extraordinary. My first Mac Book and I am absolutely  in love.
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,it is fast and the right side for my purse
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,Very good quality! The Apple MacBook Air M1 is very fast and has excellent graphics. I love the backlit keyboard.
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"It’s fast , sharp-looking, slim & powerful !Currently I have a  Mid-MacBook 2010 (Still keeping it ) and in dire need of a upgrade so, I bought this, best investment this year !"
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,I order the gaming programs and haven't been able to use it not sure why
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"What else do you expect from Apple, great laptop."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"Nice , fast and lightweight"
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,I expected more speed from it.
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,Price point for an apple laptop good. Screen is great so are the speakers. Dead easy to set up. I had my last one for 13 years hope this is the same. Only negative. The new usb-c ( lightning ) does not support the apple super drive. You have to buy an adapter.
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"It’s a total beast. Performance, battery all seems amazing."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"I was hasitating to buy used, but it was like new. No scratch, no dent, even battery charging cycle was 2. Came with box, original charger, USB-C cable. I am happy with it."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"This is the best laptop I have ever used. I got this product a week ago and works amazing. Highly flexible, stylish, long battery life, and better screen quality. I personally highly recommend this product. Thank you Apple products for making my life easy."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"very light, very convenience to carry, work very well for all my laptop use...."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"The media could not be loaded.
                



 I mostly use this computer for personal use and it is great at everyday tasks like browsing, doing homework, working, etc. I will it is not intended for gaming so if are looking a gaming laptop I would suggest a computer with an android or Microsoft processor. This will be your best bet. It is not very durable to potential drops which is why one must be very careful and handle it with care.As I discussed in the video, I highly recommend purchasing protective gear for your computer it might seem like an investment at first but it doesn’t have to be! Amazon has many deals under the “todays deals” section for any items you might need and things such as a keyboard cleaner or the trackpad protectors can be DIY’d with a bigger plastic protector.The learning curve for Apple is not that steep. It is very smart and sleek making it easy to carry anywhere.Hope this helped with your purchasing decision!"
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,Given as a gift but girlfriend loves. True test will come once she starts school later this month.
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"Pros: Battery life : 5 stars, this machine last all day and I don't even know howScreen: 2560x1600 in a 13 inch screen is remarkableLook: It's apple so I got nothing to complainSound: You can hear this from your bathroom with curtain and door closedHEAT: DOES NOT HAVE ANY FAN SOUND AND HEAT PROBLEM AT ALL. THIS THING IS QUIET !!!Keyboard: No more butterfly keyboard!Cons: Apple got the same deal for student but they attach FREE airpod so sadly I have to return this to amazon so I can that dealSmuge spot due to fingerprint or sweat on keyboard is unavoidable and very annoying to look at but I guess it is what it is.All in all, I highly recommend this to any college student especially comp sci major to buy this. I was always a window users except for my Iphone and I also have a fair share of laptop from gaming to everyday but this M1 laptop right here beat everything else at this price point."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,Using this for personal use.  Still learning how to use.  Long battery life
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,just a best laptop
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"First let's start with the overall look of the MacBook Air, it's thin, sleek and super light.  I got the gold color one and it took me a while to decide between the silver & gold. But after receiving my gold Mac, I'm so happy I went with it. The color looks so much BETTER in person, it seems to have more of a rose gold color in person but if you take a picture of it, it looks gold.I use my Mac for some web searching, emails ( when I do so the battery does good) and if I'm doing some photo editing and downloads it dies faster. I spent all day on it and it does not get hot, so that's a plus. I don't feel like I have to give it a break.I got the standard memory and just got a hard drive to upload my photos on there ( if needed)Now the camera! it's terrible LOL but that doesn't bother me much because I won't be using or doing any zoom calls. But i wish apple would make it better since it's not a cheap lap top.I also came from not having a lap top, So far is perfect for me and what I use it for. I love that apple connects everything for you and it makes it that much easier to see emails, txt , calendar etc......I also love the vibrant color and sharpest of the screen."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,Love my new laptop. I use it every day for work and it’s great!! Zero complaints.
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,Excelente MacBook
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,Excelente MacBook
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"I was able to get this Mac for around $800 in Nov. 2022. It arrived quickly and very well packed for shipping. I'm really enjoying it overall up to this point. It's definitely not a super powerful machine but for just normal everyday use it seems to be a very solid choice. Coming from a mid 2013 MacBook air its quite literally a night and day difference. Snappy response, amazing display in a very sleek form factor. If I had to complain about something, I would note that the keyboard has an extremely small travel making it a bit odd using experience at first but it's something you quickly overcome with just a couple hours of usage. Then, what I would consider the biggest downside is the lack of ports. A total of 2 USB-C ports and a headphone jack is all you get. Luckily there are countless USB-C hubs available for a decent price. I spent around $80 and got one that not only has all ports I could possibly need but also allows for a 2-monitor output. I would say for the price it's really hard to find much I don't like about it. When looking into a new Mac I was originally looking into the M2 Air but after reading up on them I heard a lot of complaints regarding overheating as well as slower overall peak speeds due to it using 1 single 8GB RAM stick opposed to the M1 using 2 4GB sticks allowing for the system to run more smoothly. When buying a base model, you're already going into it with a relatively small hard drive and low total RAM so when given the option I found it just made more sense to go with the M1 at the time of purchase. That decision was solidified when the M1 went on sale making it a nearly $500 price difference between the two models. To summarize, if you're looking for a reliable MacBook at a ""cheap"" price to have as an everyday mess around machine I 100% would say this is the one. It's nothing super powerful but it's far from sluggish. Great for normal use, streaming, browsing and minor editing etc. I have yet to find a situation in my regular use it couldn't handle, so for me it's exactly what I needed."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"My daughter is a budding photographer and got this computer to edit her photos and for college. She loves everything about it, it fits her needs perfectly."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"It's a good computer by all standards. It's pricey but you get what you pay for. Great screen and its fast. Just wish....like all electronics, that the battery lasted longer."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"Really like this laptop bought this as a gift for my wife to do her Masters and she loves it, very easy to use, super fast, screen quality is exceptional, Keyboard feels lovely and very affordable the M1 chip really made a difference only one thing if you can afford it try to bump up to the 512GB will worth it."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,This thing is beautiful! I love it! My first MacBook 😍😍!!! BUY IT
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,Linda
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,im loving my mac. loving the color
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,Absolutely Amazing Laptop! Best Laptop On The Market With New M1 Chip From Apple!! And This Coming From A Windows Users! Love This Computer 💯
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,Loved this computer. It has an Apple processor and I needed to split my drive for windows OS so I’ve returned it and got the one with an intel processor.
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,Was for my son for college and it was perfect.
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,sldkjowie
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"I purchased it to parallel windows, however it will not!Very disappointed"
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"A typical Apple product, quality product. Love it."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,Me encanta
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,Overall nice quality
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,Love it
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"The media could not be loaded.
                



 Like how lightweight this laptop is. Also, it is swift, In my opinion. The only thing I miss is a touch screen. Coming from a Lenovo to mac, it did take some getting used to, but I love it so far. I would recommend it."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"After years of using nothing but PC laptops, the M1 chip compelled me to try Macs. And let me tell you, the hype is justified. The new silicon MacBooks are simply incredible. The ARM-based silicon chip is so amazing that I was able to forgive the laptop for its downsides, which are the 720p webcam, lack of SD card slot, and not being able to upgrade RAM or SSD. Despite these drawbacks, the battery life is insane and the machine is completely silent because no fan is needed since the laptop is so heat-efficient. You're also getting a powerful laptop that outperforms the vast majority of Windows laptops in the market. To top it off, you get a touchpad that puts other laptops to shame, a beautiful aluminum design, and build quality that will last. Well done Apple."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"Love the keyboard and Touch ID feature, glad I waited this long to upgrade"
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"I had a bit of trouble adapting, found a decent online site to actually tell me how to use it as it’s way different than my old computer."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,it works perfectly! I absolutely love it! I've wanted one for years and it def lived up to the hype!
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,I love the battery life. It lasts so long that I charge it sparingly. I love the instant on feature when I lift the lid. I am impressed with the biometric scanner that allows me to log in without my password. The MacBook Air allows me to log in with my Apple Watch as well. The speed is fantastic. I am thoroughly impressed. I have an M1 Mac mini as well. I am hooked.
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,For $800 this was certainly worth a punt - Macs are generally more expensive than equivalent Windows laptops but this is a light machine worth its salt.
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"It’s a great computer;  is stupidly fast,  the battery last for 15 to 20 hrs on constant use.  If you don’t use it that much last for days without recharge.  It behaves like a smartphone but just bigger to fit a full keyboard and a big screen, with the same or better performance.  This is the new era of laptops and desktops, you’ll see soon other brands doing it too.  Because it uses “NO FAN AT ALL”, is very thin and lightweight.  I don’t need to use an egg carton on my lap to avoid overheating like the fan ones. The M1 ship is definitely a great upgrade.  Excellent idea!!!"
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,Insane battery life. Fast and NO noise. M1 chip. Best laptop I've owned.
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,Everything right on
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"The audio coming from the small speakers is incredible, I haven't needed my external speakers. The display is an upgrade from average. Convenience with the long battery life and a sleep mode that actually works flawlessly. Had an issue with a crossword app heating up the unit but other than that the first two days the verdict is thumbs up."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"Item description is exactly what I got!!! Love, love,love!!!♥️ Super fast shipping and super happy with everything so far!!!!"
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,The laptop is so lightweight and has a great display!
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"I use this to teach online. Overall extremely satisfied. Fast, reliable and looks nice. The only two things I’m not crazy about are A) the camera isn’t really HD and B) I ordered gold and it looks more like a rose gold color."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,so beautiful made. fast delivery.  It is like a new toy for me.
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,very god. thanks
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"I was worried about the compatibility of the M1 processor but by now i can tell that at the moment all My stuff is running flawless on this Mac: all Office programs, FTP clients, compressors, vpn software, database clients, etc. Even games like CS in Steam."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,It's a Macbook. Slick design lightweight. Never had any issues with any of my Macbooks. The M1 chip is nice.
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"I am coming from a PC laptop, and I have to say, I am more and more impressed with this mac air every day. Which is probably because I am learning something new every day. The screen has good brightness and color. It is super fast on opening and using apps. It is lightweight, smaller than my last one, so I can see this will be easier to travel with."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,Apple products never let me disappointed
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"I needed a new computer and I'm so glad I purchased this one. Holds a charge well, lightweight, and awesome speeds. I love this device and everything it allows me to do from emails to playing games! I wouldn't trade this for any other computer!"
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"I love everything Apple did to update the Air. It’s, by far, the best laptop you can buy right now. That’s especially true if you were a Mac user before. I wasn’t, so I had to learn where everything was and what not, but it didn’t take to long.The battery life is PHENOMENAL and I have had 0 issues with the thermals. When Apple said it would cool passively, they weren’t lying. I’ve had 8-9 programs running simultaneously and it was obviously warmer, but nothing compared to any other laptop I’ve used. The fact that it’s dead silent when running is a nice perk as well.I like how they kept a lot of the tried and true design on the outside because I don’t think many people saw anything wrong with it to begin with.The screen has amazing clarity and, in true Apple fashion, all of my Apple devices connect seamlessly.Absolutely the best laptop one can buy right now."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,Bought this laptop for my son for Christmas. He has a gaming PC but this laptop has completely blown him away. The screen is exceptional and the performance is phenomenal he says. Made for a perfect gift
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,Purchased for college
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,I have just started to use it but right out of the box it is running fine. It is my first Mac and I am impressed. The packaging is outstanding! Give me a couple of months and I’ll give a complete full review.
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"I was shocked at how great of a computer this is. It is quick, and the battery life is fantastic. I was skeptical of Apple moving away from Intel, but they knocked it out of the park."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"Bought this for daughter as all other devices were triggering her migraines. She has been able to use this with no issues. It connects to her iphone and iPad. It’s very thin and lightweight and the battery has a long life. I was skeptical at first because I could get a regular laptop at Walmart for much cheaper,But this has been worth the money. I expect her to be using in severalYears."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,Granddaughter is using for school.
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,Battery life is great
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"Bought this product on sale for during Black Friday.  Great product - Apple brand.  Easy to setup and use.  Use for streaming videos, Excel and web browsing.  While this is the base model - I might recommend getting one with 16gb RAM.  When I look at the activity monitor sometimes the memory is in the yellow range when there are too many apps open.  I usually shut down a few and it turns green again."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,Zoom calls perfect and beautiful. Video quality is excellent.  Performance is amazing.  Running Parallels and Windows 11 preview. Screen looks beautiful.  Movies look amazing.  Audio is loud and sounds spacial.  Battery lasts easily all day and sometimes two days.Blows away my 2015 MacBook Air.  Blows away my 2016 MacBook Pro.  Don't miss the Touch Bar.Ports are enough.  But wish there was one on each side.As perfect a laptop I have owned.And this M1 MacBook air run Windows 11! I use Parallels and Windows runs super fast and looks amazing.  No impacts to battery life.  I saw some reviewers say it won’t run Windows and this is not true.
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"Perfect computer for college stuff, but not good for gaming."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,Graphic designer. Great laptop.
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"Overall: Highly recommended! The M1 MacBook Air really brings the quality for speedy and responsive user experience, great build quality and excellent audio! The air is incredibly quiet and the battery life is stellar! This is really the one to buy for this generation (M1) for cost and productivity. You still need a good USB hub to get more connections but this leaves the unit highly portable, it's a reasonable trade-off. For now we have not noted any memory system issues and we got the 512 GB hard drive model so that there would be more read-write space (a bigger hard drive makes a difference)."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"This thing is fast -- like 5 times faster than its physically identical Intel predecessor. So fast that it divides users into two ages of computing: pre-M1 and post-M1. 8GB of RAM in M1-land goes a lot, lot, further.Secure your seat in the post-M1 era with this $800 entry-ticket (and sell all your pre-M1 junk), because this 2020 model is fully modern, mostly holding up to the M2."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"Back in 2012 I got a MacBook Air with 8GB i7 and a turbo... back in the day it was the most equipped... I believe it was slightly faster in the kickstart by 2 or 3 seconds... yet back then I also paid about 1700 usd, my video card broke at some point back then and I was a bit upset that my only option was to replace the whole mother board, so I kept it broken and fixed it a couple of years later about about 320 usd and it worked decently for an extra couple of years for basic work...I then got an ASUS with 16GB plus 2GB just for video as I wanted it for video editing, but it has 2TB + 256 SSD so the computer is massive and heavy and it has a cheap unresponsive trackpad making it so inconvenient to travel or work at a coffeeshop. SO eventually I am back with Mac for editing my website, answering emails, and all the other trials and tribulations of work... It is so refreshing and made me realize how much I missed this system as well."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"I could never go back to using a PC.  My only complaint is that he screen is more easily smudged than my old Macbook.  I love this little machine.  It is light, and just the right size.  The battery stays charged a long time.  I regard this as a really good purchase."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"I was really hesitant on making this big purchase through amazon, but this store came through. My laptop came in great condition with no marks or damage done during packaging and shipping. It came in the right color and everything. It works like a charm."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,replaced the 1st one on day 4 and 2nd one dead after 9 month of very light use.  Fkin apple
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"I think all products from Apple are good. So, I use many electronics from that company."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"I love my MacBook!! But it was delivered by a over packed uhaul and left in its side out side without knocking to let me know it was there,?to sign for it, not any safeguards in place. I am grateful for the thoughtful packing on your part because it was shipped in an oversized box and no extra packing, it moved freely within the box."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,I’m so glad I bought this. I wish it were touchscreen but it works just fine and it came quickly
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,Love love love this MacBook just as described I order two of them one for me and my grand baby  apple is all I know....thank you so much
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,What you would expect from Apple
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,It s my first time. Using a Mac book.  And it s beautiful and easy to use.  Good speed i recommend it.
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,It is my first mac but I like it very well.
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"I ordered the space gray version and it's beautiful! I've owned an older version of Macbook Air and this one is def faster. Not really sure if M1 has something to do with it or maybe because it's fairly new lol Whether or not it's fast, I'm still keeping it. If I kept the old one for 4 years, this version will be just fine. I'm sure it's faster and better altogether."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,We expected a NIB laptop but the Apple Security Seals were nowhere to be seen.  Who wants to spend so much and get a used item?  So we returned it and will likely be paying more for this at the Apple Store to ensure we get what we pay for.
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"excelente calidad, rápido y lo recomendaría 100%"
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,Like the size of the screen. Very clear and plenty of storage.
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,great mac for everyday use
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,What a beast
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"If you are invested in the Mac world, you know these products just work. You don't get the spinning beachball of doom. Turn it on and voila, it does what you require of it.They are fully integrated with iPads and iPhones so that when you edit a document on one device, the newly edited document is what appears on whatever other Apple device you own.They are rock solid, beautiful, durable computers with long lasting battery and, with the new M1 chip, fast."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,I like it
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,I decided to treat myself this year to this. Ordered it on the Apple website and was told 1-2 weeks. I ordered it on Amazon and it was here in 2 days for the same price! Love this! As for the product ... you can not go wrong with Apple. I was a little shook by the price but its worth every penny.
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,It's no longer necessary to spend a fortune on a laptop for college. This model has more than enough bang for the buck and the kids want Apple laptops.  I assume it will perform better than the Lenovos I purchased (2 out of 3 failed in less than 2 years)
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,I love it so much came in the original box brand new no scratches
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"I bought this laptop in December 2020. I was actually debating myself between this one or a similar Windows computer, I almost went for the Windows because the processor of the MacBook Air 2019 wasn't good enough (intel core i3), but I decided to wait and two weeks later this one was launched. It's way superior than any intel core processor, I just love it. I have been using it for almost two years now and it's as good as new. The other features are just what you expect them to be: super light, portable, hi-res screen. Would buy again."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,What i was expecting
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"I've owed two HP Laptops (yikes) and a few Macintosh Laptops (decent) over the years but this one is the best so far.  This MacBook Air M1 is just wonderful.  There are many great features but a few that standout are: Instant on when you open the lid; Long lasting battery; Incredible sound.When I first heard the sound, I was stunned.  I thought for a moment it was coming from a large sound system.  It has been engineered to sound clear and spatial."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"If this Mac lasts as long as my old MacBook Pro (15) years, I’ll be one happy camper!I love the slimness and the gold color. ❤️"
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,takes a bit getting use to but it's ok I guess
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,Very good seal pack
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,good
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"An apple product that doesn't break the bank but performs well. Got this gift for the girlfriend and she absolutely loves it. Screen is amazing with vivid colors. The battery life is pretty closed to advertised, lasts the whole day without fail. It also runs adobe programs pretty smoothly so that's a plus for working professionals. Would recommend to anyone needing a portable travel buddy that can put out work too"
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,I purchased this as I see this was the almost 'perfect laptop' for everyday task and its a big yes!Its all about the new M1 chip that speeds up and gives a great battery life. Performance is so good that I recommend this.
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"This is a great desktop. I have it paired with a Dell hi res display I purchased with my old Mac. My old Mac was getting unreliable (2015). This air is very similar to the Mac but faster, reliable. I like the larger touch pad and don't have to use a wireless mouse. I have a USB type C HUB to get more connectivity. Keyboard is great."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,This is a really nice computer. I am still learning the shortcuts that make it even more user friendly. Everyday I learn something new. Happy customer over here.
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,Muy buen producto
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"The speed and battery life is insane for this laptop. I highly recommend for users with light to high use. Unless you are graphics heavy person, this laptop should be more than enough."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,Excelente producto saludos desde Ecuador 🇪🇨
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"I was very skeptical to buy a MacBook on Amazon due to some bad reviews, but I went ahead due to the low price and trust me, it is the best decision. The laptop is brand new and genuine. M1 is amazing for multitasking and the speed is just awesome! It also has the best batteries on market."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"Great laptop for the money and awesome quality, no problems and looks new!"
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"The new M1 chip is extremely fast and extremely power efficient. Oh, and it doesn't even need fans. Handles 4k resolution great, and is super light and thin. I just wish Apple would decide to add touchscreens to Macs..."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"Picked up this model on sale for $799. If you can get it on sale, I'd recommend it even over the new M2 MacBook Air (if you're getting the base model) for those who want a capable machine that can handle day to day tasks and don't need all the bells and whistles of a Pro model.This has actually replaced a Windows machine that I was using for a long time for my daily workflow, and even with only 8 GB of memory compared to 16 on the Windows one, I find that this machine runs much better. It runs right out of the box without needing to spend a couple hours uninstalling bloat that comes standard with almost every Windows laptop that sucks up my RAM and CPU if I don't remove it. The only downside is that the 256 GB of SSD is a bit light, but since I mostly work off the cloud anyway, it's not a deal breaker. If you do need more, I would recommend buying a model with that space built in as you would need to get an external drive otherwise.Pros vs. M2 Air:- SSD is a bit faster (as it's two 128 GB modules running in parallel, while the new one is a single module) which also is a slight boost to longevity.- There is no notch on the display (I personally don't mind it, but if that's a sticking point for you this or the 13"" M2 Pro model would probably serve you better).- Slightly improved cooling system (neither Air model has an active cooling setup, but the integrated heat spreader on the M2 model is a fair bit smaller so it throttles itself a bit sooner), but not major if you don't plan on pushing too hard (and if you are, the M2/M1Pro/M1Max MBP is probably better suited for you anyway).- I find that I like the way the keyboard types a little more on the M1 model over the M2. It's definitely a matter of personal preference, but it feels a bit nicer to type on for me. Might be down to the fact that it uses the traditional wedge shape which gives a little bit of an angle to the keyboard, where the M2 MBA is more like the 2021 MBP shape.Cons vs. M2 Air:- No dedicated MagSafe charging port, meaning that you only get one available USB-C port to use when charging.- Overall system performance is a bit lower than the M2, but not really by a whole lot. If you're not planning on really stressing the system you won't notice.- Function keys are only half height, while the M2 has full height keys. Again, personal preference, but as someone with slightly larger hands who normally uses larger keyboards I prefer the full size keys.- Webcam is only 720p instead of 1080p on the M2. I don't use it that much, but if you do plan to be doing a lot of Zoom, FaceTime, etc. you may want to keep that in mind. It's still not bad, but the quality difference is something that you will notice.- Sound quality is a tad weaker in my opinion, but nothing major, and I usually use my AirPods or some other external speakers/headphones anyway.On the whole, it's still a great MacBook. Sure it's more expensive than plenty of Windows laptops, but the battery performance is solid, and even with only 8 GB of RAM (if you want more, go for a MacBook Pro instead), it's still overall a solid option for light to medium duty workloads due to how optimized the new Apple silicon is. On programs that take full advantage of it, the boost in performance is massive. Even with using Rosetta for older Intel-based programs, it's still quite fast. Compared to any Intel machine that came before it, it blows them out of the park with superior performance and battery life.If you can get it on sale, or a good refurbished one (in that case I recommend going directly to Apple), it's probably one of the best laptops on the market right now. For students and anyone looking for a Mac that's lightweight but capable, this is a solid choice."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"loved the fast shipping and excellent price, I surprised my boyfriend with this computer and he was ecstatic, super cool!!"
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,At time
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"This is a brand new 2020 model and something I never thought I could afford any time soon. I’m an author who needs to sync from my iMac desktop to a laptop, iPad and iPhone. Never knowing where I’ll be for research, notes, photos, or character sketches, the ability to move from one to the other makes my work a little easier. If quality on a budget is what you’re looking for, I highly recommend this seller and product."

 I received my new laptop without any problems, I’m very happy and satisfied."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,Am new to Mac but so far I like it.
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"Fast. Battery life never an issue. I wanted the same keys on the keyboard as the pro. Anything else was nothing but perfect! Ohhh and I wanted a whole Touch Bar, not one key for ID."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"This is my very first MacBook finally, got it out of necessity for work backup computer and will work great w/easy setup and ability to connect to home wifii. Brand new 2020, no touch screen but impeccable quality for a smaller laptop and unbeatable price!"
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"I am a senior citizen and use my laptop to store files and and transfer photos to thumb drives for storage. I do surf the net for entertainment, but I’m not a gamer. Product arrived in excellent condition and is perfect for my use."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,Love the computer overall 🥺 thanks Amazon

 It delivered in perfect condition after shipping a long way. I fell in love immediately. The keyboard is easy to navigate, the screen size is perfect. It is very light and perfect for my needs"
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"I hate that this laptop doesn’t have a USB-A port! I can’t sync my iPhone, iPad, anything that uses a USB-A port. It only has two USB-C ports, which doesn’t help me. Very disappointed. I had to buy an adapter but that doesn’t work either. I’m at my wits end!"
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"I've owned my fair share of laptops and let me tell you.. Nothing even comes close to this. Spectacular battery life, incredible display, tactile keyboard and haptic track pad with all its' gestures and features which makes multitasking a wonderful experience. to top it all off, Big Sur (os) wraps it all up and makes your workflow the greatest pleasure. Only thing I would change is the camera. It is decent in a well lit environment but struggles in the dark. Putting a bigger sensor is a hardware limitation and I understand that. Having a display this thin comes with its' sacrifices. If I could give this laptop 10 stars I would. Don't hesitate on purchasing it, you won't regret it."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"This is what I'd hoped for w/ the MacBook. Great typing, fast and super media performance. A perfect stay at home compliment to my Pixelbook Go."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"The media could not be loaded.
                



 Tenía mucho miedo pedirla pero me anime, me llego muy bien estoy emocionada realmente fue una buena inversión 🎉"
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"I’ve always wanted a MacBook, no complaints here, it’s dope."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,Otherwise it's great!
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"awesome product, hope it can lasts long."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"I've been using Mac laptops for 30 years (yes before there were Macbooks) and this is my favorite yet.With this Macbook Air I'm coming from an 8 year old MacBook Pro. In comparison, it is:Super light. Feels like carrying a book.Great feeling keyboard.Fast.Excellent battery life.Beautiful display.Overall, I am more productive and happy since I started using this MacBook Air!(When I first got it there were some bugs but perhaps they fixed them in Big Sur. It's been 3 months now, smooth sailing.)CONS:I hate Apple so much for changing the USB port. You need to buy an adapter for any external drives with the standard old USB cord to work. I bought a beautiful cover for my MacBook but they didn't plan for the fact that many people would be plugging in a long adapter so I have to take the shell off. Did I say I hate Apple for doing this?"
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"Such a beautiful laptop! It’s an adjustment going from an Hp to a Mac, but I am loving it!"
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,New to Apple...So far screen is great.
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"It’s an M1 chipped MacBook Air, has the previous version and this is the best one so far battery lasts a long time, even with hours of straight use, does not get hot while charging and no fans to hear !! Yippee."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,Have been needing a new computer for months. researched this Apple MacBook Air. Read many positive reviews. Was delivered two days ago and am very happy with my purchase!
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"I absolutely love this 2020 M1 laptop!  No blemishes, scratches or stains.  Super thin and light.  The gold color is stunning.  Has a finger security tab you can login from.  Transferring data from my old computer to this one was a breeze.  I'm experiencing a learning curve with transferring my docs and workbooks from Word and Excel to Pages and Numbers, but it's no diff than switching from Windows to iOS, just takes a bit to figure some things out. I highly recommend this laptop!."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"My grandmother’s birthday falls on Christmas Day, so she pretty much gets whatever she wants each year. This year is no different.She decided that she doesn’t like her Windows laptop anymore and wants a Mac. So our family all pitches in and we get her the cheapest new MacBook you can buy.The MacBook Air with this M1 chip is super responsive, intuitive, fast, etc.There’s just one thing, it is completely overkill for her.All she does with it is check email, do her banking, and buy stuff from Amazon.Something tells me my daughter will be using it more than her…I own a MacBook Pro with an M1 Pro and saw no loss in speed when comparing general computer tasks.The MacBook Air is awesome and is perfect for students, business, video editing, design, and so much more, but should not be your first pick for grandmothers.5 stars for Apple fangirl grandmas."
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"Works great, no issues"
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,Just simply loving it.
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,The Mac book air M1 is powerful. The color is stunning (better than the M2). This is the best Mac out there.
Apple MacBook AIR Apple M1,"Update 09/01/21:Still going strong!Unreal has really smoothed out the bugs. This thing is an absolute beast, beats my old desktop easily.I can run Photoshop, Unreal, Lots of tabs in safari/firefox, and background processes; all no issues. Heck, I can even run a game with unreal engine going in the background. I've rarely noticed slowdowns, and when I have it's always been a software issue (typically memory leaks).I've abandoned windows... Haven't loaded it outside of a VM more than a few times this year. Don't hesitate to get this if you're looking for a new laptop.Update 01/11/21:Well, I had some issues but I love this thing enough I'm sticking with it.I believe a 3rd party USB hub killed the logic board and touch ID for it. I had to wait about a month to go theough the motions, especially with the time of year. Finally got my replacement back today and I'm really happy.Unreal Engine does not run well currently. It gets crashes and will freeze the computer. Everything else runs super smoothly and I never have issues. Really happy with the laptop.Initial post:Let me start this off by saying I was very skeptical. Lifelong Windows user, I've only had an iPod touch (2011) and very briefly an iPhone 6 (I think). I also have pretty demanding needs as far as day to day laptop use goes.This thing has handled everything I've thrown at it so far. The only drawback is that my current model only has 8GB RAM, but if you're conscious about what you have open it's not an issue; even with more intensive programs like Photoshop or Unreal Engine 4. Neither of which are even optimized for the platform yet, which as stated in the title, is really impressive.Gaming has been equally impressive. To be fair, I haven't thrown a next-gen game at it yet, but I threw games that I thought would be able to max it out. Nope, Civ 6, Borderlands 1, and Oxygen Not Included all ran at Ultra with FPS staying at steady 60+ in each game, even in more intensive portions of each game. I'm not saying it'll be able to play every game at ultra, but it's definitely been able to handle more than I though it would. It almost seems to be outperforming my desktop, which has an i7@3.4, and a 970ti. I think it might if I had the extra GPU core and 16gb ram, which is crazy for a laptop at this price.Overall, it's worth every penny. I could rant about all the small features that make the OS amazing as well, but you can find videos of that online/may already be familiar."

iphone15_pro,"Every thing is good about iPhones, there's nothing compared to it's speed and ios but i was disappointed because there's no charger for it even though Indian judiciary told them to provide , still they haven't made any progress regarding charger. Why should we spend 62k and more than that for iPhones because of it's brand and Acessories comfort size and Features right if that's not there what's point of buying an iPhone.Thank you??"
iphone15_pro,"It look so fabulous, I am android user switched to apple, performance wise iPhone is more better than android due to A15 Bionic chip. I feel pleasant while using iPhone in hand. I like it very much ????"
iphone15_pro,"I tried to flip camera while recording but no facility is added here. You have to pause first then you can flip from back to front or vice versa it means you can't continue it, very awkward position. Iphone software should be upgraded so that we can make it go. It's very essential for a content creator. I purchased gimbal dji om se but it could not provided that, it's very essential for a vlogger but I was fed up after finding the basic requirements wasn't built in these products !"
iphone15_pro,100% genuine
iphone15_pro,Happy to get the iPhone 13 in Amazon offer
iphone15_pro,5 star ??
iphone15_pro,"Great Product... Nothing to say, as the Name APPLE is own identity of this product.. All is well, recommendation is 100% . Just grab this product else you missed something...."
iphone15_pro,Good product ????
iphone15_pro,Nice product
iphone15_pro,Excellent product
iphone15_pro,"My honest review after going broke buying this depreciating object.I have been using android phones since the last 10 years and finally decided to switch to iPhone! I used to roast iPhone for its prices, lack of features and also things like power adapter not given in box etc, but my last android phone (iqoo 7 legend) had lot of software related issues and battery issues after updating it to android 12, tired of bugs and software glitches in android, I finally decided to buy a iPhone and switch from android to iOS And Boy Was I right!I never even held an iPhone In my life before because of its price, but now I made a great choice even if I had to spend all my savings on it.iPhone 13 is so smooth that even my IQOO 7 Legend with 120hz feels slower than it even if iPhone has only 60hz. And I cant believe what Im seeing, all the games/apps are so much smoother and optimised than on android.I was very sceptical about the charging speed of an iPhone Because in Iqoo I had 66w fast charger where as for iPhone I had to buy 20w separate fast charger for 1800rs, but charging speed isnt disappointing.Display quality is truly flagship level and Im quite a fan of the small 6.1 display believe it or not, being able to reach the top of display with just one hand is very helpful, Build quality is great.I would recommend NOT to waste extra 40k for buying 13 pro. Because I dont think having a extra camera telephoto lens is worth spending 40k.You can see in the 3rd image attached the quality of wide angle camera pic shot on my iPhone 13, wide angle camera struggles in low light, but main camera is really good, captures true colours. Front camera is really good too, truly flagship.Speakers are Great.Battery life is better than my previous devices,iOS is very optimised in terms of battery life, easy 8hrs sot on normal usage.NOTE : While playing BGMI you loose around 2% battery every 6minutes at HD + Extreme Graphics. Which is also good. Pro Max Would Be far better in terms of battery.For the software? Yes I feel like there are few downsides, even if the software is very smooth and has very less bugs, it has two annoying things : any game gets paused when you open control centre just to check the battery etc, Lock Screen is annoying and also having to reach the top left corner just to see notifications is also annoying, clearing all notifications is also very annoying.But other than that a perfect 10/10 purchase. I was very disappointed at myself when I paid for the iPhone but when I received it I was truly happy that I bought it.Truly worth it."
iphone15_pro,Nice
iphone15_pro,Its a perfect iPhone I highly recommend this seller . Great price on their sale. The phone is good
iphone15_pro,What I like about this phone is that it is quite reasonable comparing other iphones and Is very good and nice to use.
iphone15_pro,I bought the product little expensive. Within a month price dropped by Rs.17000.
iphone15_pro,"Though we talk a lot about high price for iPhones, this is worth the amount. Smooth touch, perfect to hold in hand. For the screen size of 6.1"", it looks small overall. I could have gone for pro max but more than 1.5L budget is way too much for me :-)* Good battery back-up (With low battery mode always on, 5 hours of talk-time, around 2 hours of twitter and 2 hours of whatsapp usage, 1 hour of songs listening, 1 hour of rummy/candy crush games and notification of all these items, the battery comes for more than 24 hours for me)* Getting charged quickly from 20% to 100% within 2 hours* Perfect camera and I love that 'Live' photo option* Body design is awesome. When I held it in my hand for the first time, felt really happy about the design and the size of the iPhone 13."
iphone15_pro,Works just fine nothing special the camera is also good but during night it's not what I expected it to be and you have to charge the phone twice if you use it a lot it also heat sometimes it it doesn't like but sometimes it doesn't feel very smooth I don't know if it's value for money
iphone15_pro,Loved it
iphone15_pro,Theres no same day delivery Phone was delivered to me in 3-4 days. I had to purchase  the phone thrice so on the third attempt I finally received the phone. Battery life is better than iPhone XR. Phone is same as shown in pictures. Amazon refund policy is good. I received both refunds within 24 hours.
iphone15_pro,My device is not working (switched off)Iam not able to download Invoice and warranty documentHow can I get itService center asking the document
iphone15_pro,Best
iphone15_pro,Not worth
iphone15_pro,Nothing new features only model changed
iphone15_pro,Seals were teared but only stricker was put. I don't know whether it is new or refurbished but it's working ??????.
iphone15_pro,"This phone has well balanced HD oled sDisplay. Colours are accurate. Camera quality is very good even with 12 MP cameras. Selfies and portrait look good, but selfies indoor required little improvement which can be done through software. Battery back up is great. Faster transfer using Airdrop. I am getting a 1 and half day of battery backup with normal usage. Overall a perfect smartphone with ios experience."
iphone15_pro,Good not like android
iphone15_pro,Loving the display and overall speed!
iphone15_pro,Good charge
iphone15_pro,Actually Im android user now switched to iPhone user experience is good but camera quality isnt meet my expectations when taken photos on day times and little low lights youll get good quality photos. Night mode is worst. Battery is good for moderate users. Phone is very compact and display quality really awesome. My conclusion if you looking for privacy and protect from hackers definitely iPhone is safe. Those who are all moderate user and then buy this model
iphone15_pro,Very good I am happy
iphone15_pro,Works fine
iphone15_pro,Cool
iphone15_pro,"As it is an apple product, quality is ensured and proven"
iphone15_pro,My phone was bent for some reason. So kindly infirm check my warrenty period. Get me feedback
iphone15_pro,fine
iphone15_pro,"I mainly bought it for content creation because the software optimization was good and also because I use macbook air so data transfer between iphone is quicker than the android one, basically less hassle.Love the photo and video quality.It's also mostly for work than personal use. Customization is a bit hard but I also use android as primary phone so not an issue for me.Overall a good purchase for me."
iphone15_pro,"I bought this iPhone 13 . There was a manufacturing defect as this phone doesntHave  personal hotspot and Airdrop . Its blocked , not turning on . Deception . I cant afford this . I am now in foreign , my friend bought this iPhone . I am not in a position even to return this iPhone ."
iphone15_pro,"Smooth and fast, feels premium in hand."
iphone15_pro,I received iPhone 13 timely.Product is working great.It improved my lifestyle  as  well.Camera quality is awesome. Battery performance is pretty good.Thanks to Amazon for your great service.
iphone15_pro,"Facing heating issue, Battery performance is not that good. On screen 12 hrs only as of now. Hanging in between, which we didnt expect from Apple. Look is fantastic. Small while compared to XR."
iphone15_pro,"I finally upgraded from my trusty iPhone 5s to the iPhone 13, and let me tell you, it feels like Ive time-traveled from the past to the future! The pink color is absolutely gorgeousit's the perfect blend of subtle and stylish, making the phone look sleek and modern. Ive received so many compliments on it already.The design is everything youd expect from Apple: premium, well-crafted, and just a pleasure to hold. Coming from a 5s, its almost like I was using a rotary phone before this. I half-expected Siri to say, Welcome to the 21st century!The display is bright and vibrant, the camera is a huge leap forward, and the overall performance is incredibly smooth. Its crazy how much has changedface ID feels like magic, and the battery life is a dream compared to my old 5s, which needed a charger practically glued to it.If youre thinking about upgrading, especially if youre coming from a much older model like I was, dont hesitate. This iPhone 13 in pink is a stunner and well worth the leap!"
iphone15_pro,"I really wanted to get an iPhone and it is my first iPhone but i loved it the sound quality is great and it charges fast, the phone is a bit heavy but it looks classy the display also works well and the camera is the best ????"
iphone15_pro,"Things I liked:1. Solid Build Quality and very polished software (compared to Samsung's One UI)2. Camera:-Rear: Rear camera is pretty decent with good color accuracy in all lighting conditions. Videos are steady and smooth.3. Mic / Speakers: Mic is exceptionally well, isolates all background sounds in noisy situations. Speakers are crisp with good bass.4. Performance: This is where the phone shines, you can throw any app available on the App store and it will run it without breaking a sweat.5. Face Id works like charm, it's the best biometric phone lock out there undoubtedly.Things I wish were better:1. Battery life would have been better, I get up to 4.30 - 5 Hours SOT with mixed usage (high brightness, 1 hour calls, 2-3 hour social media, and 2 hour media playback/music)2. Charges Slow compared to my earlier Samsung. Takes almost 1.2 Hours from 20% to 80%3. Front camera is average, it fails to get correct skin tones and lighting. I keep it on default and still it produces over saturated photos.4. Dialer / phone app sucks. I am someone who makes up to 200 calls a day due to nature of my SCM work. Dialer on Samsung is far better. For unknown call you can add a note to the number in Samsung and it reflect when the person call you again, without having to save unnecessary contacts. Number pad does not detect contact unless complete number is typed."
iphone15_pro,Each and every thingLove this Product
iphone15_pro,I liked the way it was fast.
iphone15_pro,"IOS 17.5 (current version updated from 16.6)Thw worst thing as a ios user for me that the fear of update , i heared some updates get display issues battery drain issues , god sake i doesn't had any issues from ios updates , but till i care- device  was great, super handy for me, little feeling of weight .Display - The 60Hz refresh rate didn't felt badly form me cause i am used such kind of device before. - The brightness Range is so comfortable. - The 2160p60 HDR videos in youtube give blissful experianceBattery And charging - The charging time:- i took 1Hour to charge  from 20% to 91% using apple 20w original adapter and cable without any interruption(no electricity break or disconnection ,calls etc) - Battery backup - I am mostly maintain battery in btw 20% <-> 80% so i think this may get one day backup for me ,Average 5h screen on timeThe one day backup is just a advertisemnt advertisement label usaully we use, actually a day like  events,party,outing  we use -camera ,editing app, social media app more than usual use , that day i didn't get a satisfied backup . - Little temperature warming while charging , no heating issue- battery health after 6 month 98%-battery cycle count 194  after 6 monthPerfomance - Good perfomance for video editing ,photography , social media . (I am not a gamer ) Camera-  Even though i  felt some lag or stuck screens in some third party applications - The cinematic Mode is mind Blowing . i missed 13 pro or higher varients for zooming in this mode . - Actually i really miss pro variant for the tele lens and camera features while i using this . Cost is wall for me. - The photos are nice and feature like exposure adjust and filter was good and quality photos . And the 5x zoomed photos is not good for me.it reduced the pixel quality .- The video and optical image stabilisation was mind blowing . i mostly explore on videos . it was soo good , no words other than that.AND THE BIGGEST FEAR FOR ME NOW IS IOS UPDATEi turned off the auto update at first place .i heared about DISPLAY ISSUES,HEATING ISSUES and BUGS in the ios updates for 13 and 14 series.So for expencive and established brand like apple does not fair . This is the only -ve i have to say as a reminder .Also i heared without ios update display issues are happened . Buy the way it is a hardware issue one of the display provider company's batch may show the issues . but we customers cannot identify which company provides the hardaware.I will attach my battery analytics data screnshot photo here so you can better understand how the battery is good The ordering experience in the greate indian sale was worst . I planned to buy this for 45999/- in oct7 greate indian sale offer but i got canceled then i bought for 48999 that was disppointed .As a whole i didn't recommend base models ,i felt i must have buy pro variant but for person who need ios in affordable price i recommend 13 is better than 14"

iphone15_pro,Picture quality is fine but hanging issue
iphone15_pro,"Writing this review after using the phone for 5 months.Pros- camera clicks amazing pictures, video recording is the best I've seen in a phone so far compared to my previous phones. Stable videos with no shaking- battery life is good. Lasts an entire day with medium use. I don't game on the phone. Charging is as quick as it is with phones that use USB C.- display is soo good. So bright- built is solid, dropped phone a couple of times once with the cover and once without and not even a scratch.- listening to music and watching videos is a hot cos of how good the speakers r. Crystal clear with the right amount of bass and treble.Cons- phone is a tad heavy and using it for hrs on a stretch can result in pain in the wrist or fingersGot the phone in Diwali sale on discount so bang for buck if u ask me"

iphone15_pro,Excellent features
iphone15_pro,"When talking about phone, Apple is always costly and there are always +ve and -ve for everything.I have been using android for 10+ year and now I moved to Apple.There are lot of applications and few features which I am missing while moved to Apple. But what really impressed me is the power of its processor and capabilities.1. When Android phone comes with 6, 8, 12 GB RAM, the speed or performance is poor. At the same time with 4 GB RAM in iPhone was really powerful and mindblowing.2. When Android storage are full, the phone will response very slow. But Apple still surprised me with the performance.3. The video quality of Anroid phone gives from 48 MP is delivered from Apple's 12 MP camera, which is mesmerizing and absolutely brilliant.- The battery back up is okay, but could have improved. (As I am not using for gaming, it is okay to me)- As Apple started production in India, the price could have reduced."

iphone11,"Ok, so after almost 3 years I am again back into Apple Ecosystem. Switching from Android to iOS has just one disadvantage imo, and that's you can't take your WhatsApp data restored to iOS. Everything starts fresh, pretty sad. I am so glad that I chose iPhone 11 over 12. With 5G nowhere in India for at least an year will have an added advantage to iPhone 11. Spending extra 25k just for A14 chipset and OLED display is not a clever choice. Anyways, a fantastic phone with everything fit perfectly...READ MORE"

In this amount others are giving far far better than apple. One of the myth is it never gets lag, but others get after a couple of years.

Very little and apparently not visible dent on the back of my old phone cost me too much. Old phone was in good and working absolutely.

iphone11,"Well, I bought this phone in 2021. It's been three years since release.Honestly, I bought this as my secondary device. I wouldn't game much on this device. My daily use is listening to music and checking work emails. Battery is fine. With my usage, it did last me for a day which was fine. I'm not sure who would buy a 11 now, since 13 is out. Suggestion: - buy iPhone 13 mini, if budget is an issue. If not go for pro 13 models.READ MORE"

You get 4k 60 fps in video 📸. Only 2 issue you can face as a gamer first heat fast you have to use a fan to cool it and second it's a 4G phone. You get 4G in your mobile network.READ MORE

iphone11,"The previous generation iPhone design is quite classic. No wonder the whole industry follows apple. Buying iPhone 11 in 2022 is a not a great decision. It has neither a full hd screen nor 5G support. But the camera is top notch. Software glitch is minimal. Works flawlessly. Does the basic things powerfully. It may not have the ease of android, but it is trustworthy. I am done with the android phones hanging up in two years and no software support from the makers.READ MORE"

The iphone 11 is best you should buy everything is working excellent.READ MORE

iphone11,"Typing the review on the iPhone 11. I switched from a 7+. Quite impressive and butter-smooth UI. Battery life was also quite good. Haven’t had a chance to fully check out the cameras but the display is average.Edit (after 2 months): Main camera is amazing. Ultra wide is not that great (probably better in 12). Good photos in most conditions. Overall, if you want an iPhone this is probably the best value offer till 12 drops in price or 13 is launched.READ MORE"

iphone11,Excellent product! Don’t listen to a single negative review! Just go for purchase without any second thought. It has no power adapter and EarPods but you can use any Bluetooth Headphones for the same. But the product is worth without adapter and EarPods also at this price range.

Macbook M3 Pro,Absolute beast of a machine! The M3 Pro chip handles everything I throw at it without breaking a sweat. Video editing is smoother than ever.
Macbook M3 Pro,Battery life is incredible - getting through a full workday plus some evening browsing with plenty of juice left. Apple's efficiency is unmatched.
Macbook M3 Pro,The Liquid Retina XDR display is stunning. Colors pop and HDR content looks like I'm watching a high-end TV rather than a laptop screen.
Macbook M3 Pro,Upgraded from Intel MacBook Pro and the difference is night and day. No more fan noise and performance is consistently excellent.
Macbook M3 Pro,"Perfect for software development. Running multiple IDEs, Docker containers, and simulators simultaneously with no lag whatsoever."

Macbook M3 Pro,"The thermal management is impressive. Even during intensive tasks, it stays cool and quiet. No more burning my lap during heavy workloads."
Macbook M3 Pro,"120Hz ProMotion display makes everything feel buttery smooth. Once you experience it, you can't go back to standard refresh rates."
Macbook M3 Pro,Excellent for music production. Handles large orchestral templates and complex plugin chains without any audio dropouts or latency issues.
Macbook M3 Pro,"The return of HDMI and SD card slot is a game-changer. No more carrying dongles everywhere I go. Thank you, Apple!"
Macbook M3 Pro,Speakers are mind-blowing for a laptop. Spatial audio actually works and makes movies feel immersive. Better than many dedicated Bluetooth speakers.
Macbook M3 Pro,macOS optimization with the M3 Pro is seamless. Everything just works without any hiccups or compatibility issues with my workflow.
Macbook M3 Pro,Perfect balance of performance and portability. Powerful enough for professional work but still easy to carry around campus or coffee shops.
Macbook M3 Pro,The keyboard is a joy to type on. Good travel and responsive feedback - can type for hours without fatigue during long coding sessions.
Macbook M3 Pro,Webcam quality is excellent for video calls. Studio lighting feature actually works well in low-light conditions for professional meetings.
Macbook M3 Pro,SSD speeds are blazing fast. Opening large applications and transferring multi-gigabyte files takes seconds rather than minutes.
Macbook M3 Pro,"Great for data science work. Python, R, and machine learning libraries all run natively and efficiently on the M3 Pro architecture."
Macbook M3 Pro,The unified memory architecture is revolutionary. 18GB feels like much more than traditional RAM due to how efficiently it's utilized.
Macbook M3 Pro,Touch ID is fast and reliable. Love being able to unlock and authenticate purchases with just a touch - integrates perfectly with my workflow.
Macbook M3 Pro,"Ecosystem integration with iPhone and iPad is flawless. Handoff, Universal Control, and AirDrop make switching between devices effortless."
Macbook M3 Pro,Surprisingly capable for gaming. Runs Resident Evil Village and Baldur's Gate 3 smoothly at medium-high settings. Impressive for a Mac.
Macbook M3 Pro,The notch doesn't bother me at all. Menu bar items fit nicely around it and most apps hide it in full-screen mode anyway.
Macbook M3 Pro,"Excellent for photography work. Lightroom and Photoshop run beautifully, and the color-accurate display is perfect for editing."
Macbook M3 Pro,Fast charging is a lifesaver. Can get from 0 to 50% in about 30 minutes when I forget to charge overnight before important meetings.

Macbook M3 Pro,The setup process was incredibly smooth. Migration Assistant transferred everything from my old Mac perfectly in under an hour.
Macbook M3 Pro,Excellent value when considering the performance per watt. The efficiency translates to real-world battery life benefits daily.

Macbook M3 Pro,The resale value of MacBooks is fantastic. Knowing I can recoup a good portion of the cost in a few years makes the investment easier.
Macbook M3 Pro,"Overall, the most well-rounded laptop I've ever owned. Excels at everything from casual browsing to professional creative work."
Macbook M4 Pro,A Genuine Powerhouse for Creative Work - Upgraded from an Intel MacBook Pro. This is not an upgrade; it's a revolution. Rendering 4K video in Final Cut Pro is now instantaneous. The battery life is insane—I got through a full 10-hour workday of coding and video calls and still had 40% left.
Macbook M4 Pro,"The Display is Otherworldly - The XDR ProMotion display is worth the price alone. HDR content is stunning, and the motion clarity for scrolling and design work is buttery smooth. It makes my old monitor look dull and blurry."
Macbook M4 Pro,"Finally, No Fan Noise! - I'm a music producer, and my previous laptop's fans would spin up during heavy plugin use. The M4 Pro is dead silent 99% of the time. Even during heavy loads, it's a quiet whisper. Unbelievable performance without the noise."
Macbook M4 Pro,"All-Day Battery is Real - I'm a university student. I unplugged at 8 AM, went to classes, did research, streamed content in the evening, and went to bed with 20% battery. This is the laptop I've been waiting for my entire academic life."
Macbook M4 Pro,"Perfect for Software Development - Running multiple Docker containers, an IDE, and a local server is a breeze. The M4 Pro doesn't even break a sweat, and the 32GB RAM handles everything I throw at it. The keyboard is also a joy to type on for hours."
Macbook M4 Pro,"Worth Every Penny for Professionals - If your time is money, this machine will pay for itself. Tasks that used to take minutes now take seconds. The build quality is impeccable, and it feels like a true professional tool."
Macbook M4 Pro,"Excellent for Photo Editing - The color accuracy on this display is perfect for my photography work. Editing 50MP RAW files in Lightroom is incredibly fast, with no lag when applying masks or filters."
Macbook M4 Pro,"A Gaming Surprise - I bought this for work, but tried some games like Baldur's Gate 3 and Resident Evil Village. I'm shocked at how well they run on high settings. Apple Silicon is becoming a real gaming contender."
Macbook M4 Pro,"The Best Webcam on a Laptop - The 1080p FaceTime HD camera with Studio Lighting is fantastic. My colleagues always comment on how clear I look on video calls, even in poor lighting."
Macbook M4 Pro,Seamless Ecosystem Integration - Handoff with my iPhone and iPad is flawless. I can start an email on my phone and finish it on the MacBook without a hiccup. Universal Clipboard is a game-changer.
Macbook M4 Pro,"Cool and Efficient - I use this on my lap for hours, and it never gets uncomfortably hot. The thermal management on the M4 Pro is a massive achievement."
Macbook M4 Pro,Sound Quality is Immersive - The speakers are unbelievable for a laptop. Watching movies feels like a mini-cinema experience. The spatial audio really works.
Macbook M4 Pro,"A Reliable Workhorse - No crashes, no slowdowns, just pure, consistent performance. macOS is so well optimized for this chip. It just works."
Macbook M4 Pro,Great for Data Science - Running Python scripts and Jupyter notebooks is incredibly fast. The neural engine seems to accelerate some of my machine learning workflows noticeably.
Macbook M4 Pro,"Future-Proofed - With the M4 Pro chip and 1TB SSD, I feel confident this machine will handle my needs for the next 5-7 years without any issues."
Macbook M4 Pro,"Almost Perfect, But... - An incredible machine, but the price for RAM and SSD upgrades is still too high. I wish the base model came with 16GB/512GB as standard."
Macbook M4 Pro,"The Notch is Still There - You stop noticing the notch after a day, but I still wish Apple would find a way to implement Face ID without it. Otherwise, a flawless device."
Macbook M4 Pro,"A Bit Heavy for a 14-inch - The build quality is premium, but it comes with some heft. It's noticeable in a backpack compared to some ultra-thin Windows laptops."
Macbook M4 Pro,"Limited Ports - I love the return of the HDMI and SD card slot, but I still need a dongle for my USB-A devices and Ethernet. It's 2025, Apple."
Macbook M4 Pro,"Wish it Had More Gaming Support - Performance is stellar, but the library of native Mac games is still limited. If you're a hardcore gamer, this isn't your primary machine."
Macbook M4 Pro,"Some Software Incompatibility - Most of my apps work great, but I have one legacy piece of business software that doesn't run on Apple Silicon yet. Had to set up a workaround. Do your compatibility checks!"
Macbook M4 Pro,"The Price of Accessories - The laptop is expensive, and so are Apple's own accessories. Buying a second charger or a docking station hurt almost as much as the laptop itself."
Macbook M4 Pro,"Gets Smudgy Easily - The Space Black looks gorgeous, but it's a fingerprint magnet. You'll be wiping it down constantly to keep it looking pristine."
Macbook M4 Pro,"Not a Huge Leap from M3 Pro - Upgrading from an M3 Pro MacBook Pro? The performance gain is there, but it's not earth-shattering. Probably not worth the upgrade cost unless you have a specific need for the neural engine improvements."
Macbook M4 Pro,"Bloatware? On a Mac? - It comes with a few pre-installed apps like Apple TV+ and Apple Arcade that I had to delete. Not a big deal, but it felt a bit un-Apple."
Macbook M4 Pro,"Charging Brick is Separate - A minor annoyance, but for a premium product, the charging cable and brick are separate in the box. It feels less premium than it should."
Macbook M4 Pro,"Wish it Came in More Colors - The Silver and Space Black are nice, but I'd love to see the iMac colors come to the Pro line. A dark blue would be amazing."
Macbook M4 Pro,"Good, But Overkill for Me - I bought this for general use and occasional photo editing. It's fantastic, but I realize now I would have been perfectly happy with a MacBook Air. I paid for power I don't use."
Macbook M4 Pro,"The Base Model is Gimped - The base model with the M4 (non-Pro) and 8GB RAM feels like a trap. It struggles with multitasking. You MUST upgrade to the Pro chip and 16GB RAM, which skyrockets the price."
Macbook M4 Pro,"First Unit Had a Dead Pixel - My first unit arrived with a dead pixel right in the center of the screen. Amazon's return was easy, and the replacement is perfect, but it was a frustrating start for such an expensive item."
Macbook M4 Pro,"macOS Learning Curve - Coming from Windows, there's a definite learning curve. Some things are more intuitive, others are more frustrating. The hardware is 10/10, but I'm still getting used to the software."
Macbook M4 Pro,"Runs Warm Under Sustained Load - While it's silent most of the time, during a 3-hour long 8K video export, the area above the keyboard got quite warm. Not burning hot, but warmer than I expected."
Macbook M4 Pro,"Notch Cuts into Full-Screen Apps - In some full-screen applications, the menu bar doesn't expand, and the notch actually cuts into the content. It's a poor design choice for a 'Pro' machine."
Macbook M4 Pro,"SSD Speeds are Slower on Base Model - Be warned! The 512GB base model has a single NAND chip, making its SSD read/write speeds significantly slower than the 1TB and higher models. This is unacceptable for a 'Pro' device."
Macbook M4 Pro,"Limited Upgradeability - Everything is soldered on. You're stuck with the RAM and SSD you buy at the start. For a machine meant to last years, this feels like a planned obsolescence tactic."
Macbook M4 Pro,"Bloated and Buggy macOS - My unit came with Sonoma 14.5 and it's been buggy. Wi-Fi drops, external display issues, and some app freezes. The hardware is great, but the software is letting it down. Hoping for a fix soon."
Macbook M4 Pro,"DOA - Dead On Arrival - The laptop wouldn't turn on out of the box. Tried all troubleshooting steps. Now I have to go through the hassle of a return. For a $2000+ machine, this is unacceptable quality control."
Macbook M4 Pro,"Screen Flickering Issue - After a week of use, the screen started flickering intermittently. A quick search online shows I'm not alone. There seems to be a hardware defect in some early batches. Returning for a refund."
Macbook M4 Pro,"The Most Expensive Paperweight - It's useless for my specific engineering software, which only runs on Windows x86. Even with Parallels, the ARM version of Windows has compatibility issues. My fault for not researching thoroughly, but buyers beware: check your critical software first."
